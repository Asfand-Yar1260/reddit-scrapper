It was one of the most unrealistic bullshit advice I've ever heard and made me want to blow my brains out. It genuinely worried me as to how many upvotes that comment got. I guess my marriage with my SO is over because we've been arguing and attending couple's parenting therapy to refine some things before our kid comes into the world... lmao.\n"

It breaks your confidence in your own experience and your ability to think for yourself in a major way. \n\nI remember when every online argument became \"gaslighting\" and I was so mad about it. \n\nGaslighting is when I was told my literal pain was just me pretending to get attention, that my memory of physical abuse was made up so I can be lazy, that my memory of SA was just me trying to get away from my step dad because I hate responsibility, etc. until I believed it so fully that I ended up in inpatient care thinking I was unforgivable for being so manipulative and attention seeking. \n\nIt's not when someone doesn't agree with you ffs.\n"

Okayyyy but then what’s an appropriate balance then? Should actors only date actors? What if one actor gets more popular during the relationship and thus gets more influence? Do they have to break up now? Are directors only allowed to date directors? Do the same popularity surge rules apply? \n\nIn the real world with the laymen, I’ve actually seen people on this app say that when a husband was promoted at his job (a job that the wife was not at), that became a power imbalance and it was time to end it. And they were not trolling. And were not downvoted. How…how does that work…?\n"

They are so quick to judge someone's relationship they are willing to completely remove any agency of the person they perceive as the 'lesser' partner. It's one thing to criticise a power imbalance between a young teen and someone older, but they seem to want to extend childhood into the mid thirties.\n\nAt 18 someone can join the army and fight for their country, take out a mortgage or enter into a contract, but the second they enter a relationship with someone outside some arbitrary acceptable range they are suddenly completely incapable of making an informed decision. If that person then argues their case that they are quite happy with their choice of partner, then that gets used as evidence of 'grooming'.\n\nI'm pretty sure it reflects a lack of life experience and an inability to look outside their own idealised narrow echo chamber of opinion.\n"

I’m highly introverted (even when I took the MMPI for an ADHD evaluation they were like “GOD you’re introverted”) but their suggestion wasn’t to just shut myself away with tea and a good book.

I have to have the majority of my time spent alone or I feel exhausted. \n\nI am also very popular. I get invited out often. I have exactly zero anxiety about public speaking or talking to a stranger. I have zero trouble standing up for myself or confronting problems. \n\nReddit thinks social anxiety and their lack of social skills makes them and introvert. It makes it easier for them to accept it instead of working on bettering themselves.\n"

				"Comment": "The only resume I have thrown right in the proverbial shredder was that of the wife of a friend of mine. I was attempting to get her a job at my employer. She had no degree or relevant experience, but we needed a receptionist, and people commonly move up from those jobs into other admin positions. Plus, it's government work, so good benefits, lots of paid holidays, etc. Bottom line, I was doing this underqualified, unemployed person a massive favor by giving her a reference and a chance. We didn't have any other applicants. The job was hers to lose. She didn't know that, so she brought her A game. Here are some excerpts from her cover letter:\n\n\"I may not have a degree, but I have what engineers don't have, 10 years of experience.\" \n\n\"Engineers aren't very organized people and I can keep them in line.\" \n\n\"I have better social skills than engineers do.\" \n\nI am not paraphrasing. Those are things she wrote when she sent me her resume and cover letter to look over before she submitted them online to apply. I was just like, \"You know I'm an engineer, right?\" She did. I continued, \"You know the job you'd be applying for is a receptionist position, not an engineer position, right?\" She seemed pretty sure she could move up and be an engineer in a year or so. That is not at all a thing in my field (it's one of those fields where everyone is required to be licensed and you have to have a degree in this just to be allowed to take the exam to get the license), but she was absolutely sure it was. \n\nI told her that if she was going to submit this, she wouldn't be hired because the entire panel was engineers. She didn't listen, and submitted it. She even listed me as a reference. I told my boss she was someone I was trying to help and she wouldn't help herself, which was accurate, but \"I've got what engineers don't have, 10 years of experience!\" became the office joke for years to come. Every time someone reached the 10 year mark of their career, we'd be like, \"You can't be an engineer anymore. The crazy lady said 10 years is the limit.\" lol\n"

His resume wasn’t terrible, but there were gaps. He listed his high school graduation date and then his AA degree from the local CC was a good 10 years later. I mean, that’s ok, but there was no work experience listed for that time period either, soooo. \n\nThen came the interview with my lead technician and me. Walk the guy into a small meeting room and sit down. Before I can even introduce us, he pulls this laminated piece of paper out of his folio slams it down on the table and pushes it across the table and says, “So when do I start?”\n\nThe document was a letter of recommendation from his CC physics teacher. A glowing assessment of the candidate which greatly conflicted with my assessment based on his behavior. \n\nHe did not get the job.\n"

				"Comment": "So I’ve never trashed a resume, but twice in my career I’ve had to make the decision to fire someone during their first week. \n\nFirst was for a customer service representative. The job requirements were fairly simple; good understanding of excel, prior experience with quickbooks (this was at a small business), and bilingual Spanish and English. She said “I’m an expert at excel. I know everything it can do.” First red flag, but I wasn’t in the interview where she said that, so I only found out after the fact. Said she had worked with quickbooks for 5 years at her last job, and grew up in a Spanish speaking household and it was her first language and learned English in school. \n\nCut to the first week; any Spanish callers she would put on hold and make up some excuse of how she was in the middle of something and needed one of the other reps to get it. After a couple of days the other reps realized she couldn’t speak Spanish so they started talking shit about her, in Spanish, in front of her, and when they would laugh, she would laugh along like she understood the joke.  \n\nWhen she did basic onboarding with quickbooks, our accountant said it was like she’s never used any accounting software before, let alone quickbooks. \n\nWhen I was showing her how to use the excel spreadsheets that were built to run all of the order entry, she was flabbergasted by a basic formula that multiplied three fields together. When I told her there’s a vlookup function, she said “oh, I didn’t know I would need to know programming.” (Which by the way, she didn’t need to know it, I was just explaining how it worked. \n\nAnyway, started on Monday, sent packing Friday morning. Any one of those things we might have kept her and let her grow into the role, but she straight up lied about the only three requirements on the posting. Sayonara.\n\nThe second was much more recent; last year in fact. The private equity firm that owns the corporation I work for owns another company on the east coast. They were hit with a ransomware attack and their IT team was completely inept, so the private equity firm contracted our IT team to fly out and help them. One of the things we were going to be doing, aside from remediating the issue, was onboarding their new IT director, getting them familiar with the existing infrastructure (which we were rebuilding for them) and then making clear the expectations around his role and what the board would be wanting from him. \n\nHe showed up on his first day at 10:30AM; we had been there since 7. We talked to him for about 10 minutes; introduced ourselves and talked about which areas of what is now HIS network we were focusing on, and made it clear we would only be in town for three more days before we had to fly back to LA. We said feel free to jump in with any of us and we’ll show you what we’re doing, why it’s important, and how it relates to everything. He proceeded to go to his new office, shut the door (didn’t meet anyone else in the company) and “set up his email” for the rest of the fucking day. Oh, and he left at 3:30. We were there until 7, went to dinner, and then proceeded to continue working until 1AM. We did that every day we were there. Remember, we’re in major crisis mode. The next day he comes in, 10:30 again, and goes straight to his office, closes the door, and said he needed to finish setting up his email. He had one meeting with the CEO, where he only talked about his hobbies, and then left for the day at 2:30. On the third day, he came in, and was fired first thing in the morning. \n\nThe conversation was something like “look man… you have to run this whole operation; we know it right now because we’ve been building it for you. You have no idea how to operate and maintain this when we leave, and you’ve wasted two of our 4 days here doing a task that takes 3 minutes for a level 1 it tech. Hell, you could have TASKED one of your L1 techs to do it for you, so you could do, you know, DIRECTOR shit. But you’re clearly not the right guy for this role, because the right guy would have been in the trenches with us, helping where possible, and learning everything there is to learn.” \n\nKinda felt bad about that one, the guy quit another high paying job to take this one. But man, if you can’t put in effort your first week in the job when the entire company is in a crisis mode and you’ve got contractors on site working 16 hour days… ya… fuck off.\n"

One of my coworkers was doing resume evaluations for our boss and opened the Linktree, finding links to an R-rated Twitter account, a PG-13 Insta, her Onlyfans, and to her content on several other porn sites. My coworker and boss were not amused, and they were debating whether someone was trolling the company or if it was a bizarre spam attempt. Her resume was rejected, and she was sent an automated \"Thank you, good luck in your search, please try again in the future\" email. \n\nA few months later, we were advertising another open entry-level position when her resume came through again. My boss was doing the resume evals and recognized the name. He opened it a second time, while commenting to another of my coworkers about the inappropriate resume (he's not a perv, but was just surprised to see it again.) When my boss clicked the Linktree URL again to show the coworker, he was greeted with a perfectly normal collection of engineering links, including a link to her electronic resume, her LinkedIn, several projects she'd worked on, and a GitHub account. \n\nOur best guess is that the applicant had accidentally copypasted the wrong Linktree URL the first time. She was still rejected for the second position. At that point, several employees had seen everything, and my boss decided that moving her resume forward for interviews would be inappropriate. Bit of a shame too. Solid GPA from a well-respected CS program, interesting projects, and a demonstrated ability to take on some absolutely massive workloads (sorry, I'm weak and couldn't resist.) \n\nWhen applying for a job, please don't include links to your nudes. Aside from a handful of socially awkward software engineers, most of our people don't want to see them.\n"

I don't usually do this, but I recreated her resume, re-organized it and corrected grammar/spelling mistakes and sent it back to her.  I hope she got a job.  She wasn't a good fit based on her resume, otherwise I would have given her the benefit of the doubt and at least interviewed her.\n"

Her resume was bonkers, just a giant list of every single last thing she had ever done in chronological order going back nearly twenty years. It was... Several.. pages. I cut it down to a one pager and sent it back, explaining that an network engineer job might not quite translate from fixing and flying helicopters, but I wished her the best. She emailed me back to say my version of her resume made no sense because it only showed the last eight years. There's no saving some people.\n"

I was managing a chain pizza joint and this 70+YO guy just wanted some extra cash for the bar and something to do.  I hired him immediately.  His \"name\" was Dude, and was one of the best hires I ever made.  I only interviewed him out of curiosity, but he was an amazing fella and just great to conversate with.  Plus he never thought twice about doing any side-work that was assigned.  Never any complaining.  Nothing was beneath him. \n\nHe died a couple years in from liver failure...turns out he was an alcoholic.  The kind that was at the bar when they opened to keep the shakes away.  It's scary thinking about hiring him as a person driving all over town, but it was what it was.  I never had any idea he was intoxicated.  RIP, Dude.\n"

With the exception of one visit for a Mother’s Day brunch served buffet style, it was the only dish I ever ordered from the place. \n\nThe last time I visited I didn’t see it on the menu so I asked about it; Not a single employee knew what I was talking about. They brought out the main chef (cook?) who they claimed had been cooking there for years. The man looked at me incredulously and said “we can’t make salad with cooked lettuce, lettuce wilts when heated, it would be no good.” So I googled grilled caesar salad and showed the results to them, they humored me with feigned interest and apologized again and that was the end of it. I had a basic cold Caesar salad with a side of shrimp (B- at best). \n\nTo this day I cannot explain it. It’s my own personal Mandela effect. I wish I was someone who posted pictures of food so I’d have had proof. \n\nLong story to say… yes, this salad is PHENOMENAL.\n"

There are people who keep instant on hand for this, but that rubs me the wrong way. \n\nThe only issue is if you’re doing something that requires little to no water. \n\nA tip (if you want) Coming from chocolate, and now working in coffee: if you have something that has milk/dairy, but cannot handle more moisture than that, I’d steep the milk with some coffee grounds to make it flavoured the way you want it. \n\nPlace I used to work did a “meringue based ice cream” where you can’t add much in the way of liquids other than the cream you add at the end (you fold it in). So we would steep the cream with whatever flavouring (coffee, lavender, etc) so we didn’t compromise the structure. You also get to add whatever high quality coffee you’d like!\n"

She buy buckets of buttercream icing or fondant from Sams and never make anything from scratch.  She hires cake decorators and pay them $8 dollars an hour.\n\nEverytime customers make a big fuss about how delicious the cake was, I just internally eye roll so hard and try my hardest not to say anything.

That gives it the authentic takeaway flavour.  That, and poaching the chicken breast first, so the water content of the chicken doesn't saturate the onions and noodles.\n"

				"Comment": "When I cook pasta, I boil water in barely enough water to cover the pasta (and I use correspondingly less salt), but I stir it for the first couple of minutes to prevent the pasta from sticking together. I do this because the resulting pasta water is really starchy, and this starchy pasta water works great for thickening sauces and emulsifying oil-based sauces.\n\nBoiling your pasta in much less water also means the water comes to a boil much faster because there's less of it to boil.\n\nFor some of my pasta dishes, I cook the pasta \"risotto style\" (pasta risottata, a legitimate pasta cooking method), where all the pasta water gets absorbed or boiled off. The resulting concentration of starch is particularly useful for emulsifying in oils. I do spaghetti aglio e olio this way, and it turns out great.\n"

It will make things go SO much easier. Be patient with your cooking. If you get in a hurry, things can go south really fast. Low and slow is usually better, depending on the recipe. And be realistic about how much time things take. Good example is bacon. I never fry it. I bake it in the oven on a cookie sheet with foil. Takes longer, but comes out evenly cooked and most importantly I don’t have to stand over it pretty constantly.\n"

				"Comment": "Okay, this is coming from a professional chef who specializes in baking, so listen up! If you cook anything cake-like and the ridge of the pan is higher than what the thing rose to, then you can add a layer of icing immediately after it comes out of the oven. Yes, it'll melt, but then the texture will change to a midway point between ganache and normal icing after it's cooled back down again! Also, the seal it creates is so strong, that it preserves the moisture of the thing underneath. Perfect for making brownies that aren't hard as rocks, like most people's! Especially because, after they've cooled, if you cut the brownies up, wrap them individually in plastic wrap, and then freeze them, then they'll have retained enough moisture and crumblyness to end up with a taste and texture that's nearly indistinguishable from an ice cream sandwich! Try it if you don't believe me!\n"

				"Comment": "If you’re baking and want something to be really tender but stable (like a cake), try reverse creaming. Instead of creaming your butter and sugar and then adding in ingredients, add your softened butter (or shortening or what have you), to your flour mixture first. Essentially, it limits the development of the gluten which is what can make baked goods tough. It’s a good way to closely mimic store-bought mixes while still being home made. \n\nIf making bread from scratch, ALWAYS knead the dough. It’s super easy to over-knead with mixers. You can sense when your dough is actually ready by hand instead of guessing. Makes a world of difference. \n\nAnother baking tip — have a spray bottle of just water on hand to squirt into your oven before putting in your baked goods. The added moisture almost always improves the texture. \n\nIf you’re cooking a Latin American dish — add Mexican oregano. It’s different from your usual oregano and it the flavor profile is earthy, warm, and slightly spicy. \n\nIf you want to eat sauerkraut and you’re an American: rinse your kraut first. Our kraut in America is waayyyyy over vinegarated compared to the real German stuff. \n\nI have plenty more too: an a trained professional baker and I love to cook. So if you have questions for your baked goods, please feel free to ask!\n"

Then tell people it's my \"famous spiced ____ recipe\".\n\nI did it during the holidays, using a recipe a fling of mine gave me for espresso brownies. Bake brownies (optional to add spices in the brownie batter), then mix powdered sugar and powdered instant coffee powder together. Add a bit of water, mix until it's like an icing, then pour all over the brownies while in the tray and let it rest a bit. Enjoy!\n\nFor enhanced flavor, let it rest overnight in the fridge that way. And even if you mess up powder ratios, it'll be good, regardless. My ex's uncle went \"HOOOOLY SHIT! These are fucking BOMB! MM!\", and a family friend said they were excellent/stellar. SO nice.\n"

It should taste like seawater.  The pasta will absorb some of that salt and taste amazing. Don’t bother with oil in the pot,  the oil will float on top and not touch the pasta anyway.  \n\nReserve a splash of pasta water for the sauce.  It helps thicken it.  But since it’s super salty, plan the salt in the sauce accordingly. \n\nDon’t oil the pasta.  You want the sauce to stick to the pasta and it’ll slide right off if you use oil.  Select a good quality olive oil for a finishing touch.  Good quality olive oil will taste grassy and peppery in the back of your throat.\n"

He has been having fits at the price of wings here because they used to be a pretty common lunch for him (he works from home and I would toss some into the air fryer for him, at least it was healthier than what he used to get at the work cafeteria lol) and now they are a rare rare treat.\n\nHe is pretty stoked about this time of year though. I currently have 7 large turkeys thawing to be processed thru for the freezer and to can (at $0.69lb I hit the sale big and we'll eat it until Sept) and he will get mega wings, one or two at a time as a treat for his lunches. But normal wings? Rare. Thank everything I learned how to properly brine and cook the breasts, they, barring whole chickens, are the cheapest chicken to buy anymore.\n"

The growers, as they have income now, can actually afford to eat things other than just quinoa.\n\nThat said, the expansion of quinoa agriculture is causing issues as sustainable practices aren't well developed.  When quinoa was a subsistence crop no one cared about the sustainability practices of the farmers growing it for local consumption; now that there's global demand there's growing global interest as well.\n"

Because a ton of people have started camping at the stores at about the time the workers bring out the new items, and will pick through them to get things they could hawk over ebay or whatever for more. Take milk glass, four example. Your grandmother probably has a milk glass vase or glasses. The store I worked at would put out a vase for $10, these people would then try to haggle it down to $2, then turn around and sell it on eBay for $50.\n"

Owners were trying to get people there to clean up.  We had just driven 8 hours (this was on a road trip).\n\nI called and managed to make a reservation at a hotel while sitting in our car outside the Airbnb.  Staying at the hotel ended up not even being that much more expensive and was much nicer (even not accounting for the failed cleaning).\n"

I booked about 2 months in advance of when we wanted to go, so definitely not last minute.\n\nWhen I searched on airbnb, all I found were off-season ski condos that looked fresh out of 1986. For the time we wanted to stay, it was $1300 and the properties were about a half hour drive from most of the stuff we wanted to do.\n\nSo, I started looking at hotels/motels (gasp!). Ended up staying at a great motel, in the thick of where we wanted to stay and it even had a heated pool, all for $700. We showed up, got our key, stayed for a few days, dropped off our key when we left - no cleaning, no stripping beds, no sweeping, no putting things in the washer, no taking out garbage, etc.\n"

Not to sound elitist, but the late 90s, very early 2000s, the clientele were people who were really into quality movies and an upscale crowd.  It was a distribution network for great content.\n\nNow, you're paying a lot for Adam Sandler, light Korean torture porn, and 17 different cake shows.  Now it's a hackneyed movie/TV studio.\n"

Either you are \"free\" and have PPV or you charge a monthly sub and no-PPV allowed. Like when Disney+ added Mulan (the live action one) for $30. You already pay for the service and now I have to pay more for something new?\n"

Anything \"fun\" would be then turned into a shithole community full of pretentious fucks insulting people that does not meet the current \"trend\".\n\nSo when airsoft first hit here, we tried it of course. It was amazing and the experience is a good way to make friends AND work your mental and physical processes not to mention simulated combat gives you the opportunity to hone problem solving skills. It was a gentleman's game wherein you get hit, you announce you got hit.\n\nNow when it became popular, everyone is cheating and asking fights, being dicks to each other. They don't call the hits and they even use it as an excuse to do \"gang shit\". Next became the oogle fest for ladies who are in there not to participate but only to look good for some of the players or whatever. Some of the girls ignored them but they became uncomfortable because the other guys were talking shit about how \"this ain't a girl activity\" and that they should just \"cosplay like this pretty girl here\" and some shit.\n\nIt deterred a lot of actually good people. It just broke the experience making it really sad to join in and not participate. Last time I joined was years ago, almost a decade I think. It was the saddest match because my sniping is on point but no one is calling. I threw a grenade and then breached with some 3 guys doing semis but they just looked back at us and started shooting back. They did not call the shots yet we did ours.\n\nI sold my gear a few months after that.\n"

So it was 8$ a couple of years ago, went up to 11$ but is very frequently on sale for 9$ now. And a lot of the produce is almost the same price it was +- a 1$. My total grocery bill went up about 40$ a week but now it’s often back down close to what it was a couple of years ago. \n\nThat said you have to have the ability to pay up front and store the stuff when it’s on sale. I have a house and a chest freezer. A lot of people don’t have the room or can’t buy 10 bags of something when it’s on sale and put it in the freezer.\n"

Panel and inverter adders had lower adders a lot of the time, same with cost baselines for full-service installers. The solar lenders interest rates started at 0.59%, dealer fees peaked at ~21.75% iirc. \n\nLots of the panel and inverter adders have gotten a bit cheaper now, but redlines have gone up by $1+/watt in most states which more than makes up for the lower equipment adders. And don’t even get me started on the lenders. Now the absolute lowest APR with most lenders that customers can get is 3.99% if they’re lucky but usually a 4.59% is the lowest they can go. The dealer fees that come with those rates is around 37-38% though. \n\nMy 2 cents: finance solar as a cash deal using a HELOC, your credit union, or do the highest APR with the lowest dealer fees (usually same as cash cost) and pay that bad boy off quicker than the loan term\n"

When I was in middle school ~25 years ago, there was an awareness campaign called \"Every 15 Minutes\", because there was a fatal road accident involving a teenager in the US every fifteen minutes on average, every single day. And that was just teenagers.\n\nIf you look at the numbers today, they're vastly better. The total deaths across all age groups is one per 12 minutes, which is a hell of a lot better than one per 15 minutes for just 13-19 year olds. \n\nLooked at from another statistic, the number of fatalities per 100 million miles driven, the difference is much more stark. Last year it was 1.35 fatalities per 100 million miles. In 1998, when I attended that awareness campaign event, it was 3.6 fatalities per 100 million miles driven. \n\nWe're almost 3 times less likely to die from vehicle crashes today, despite there being many more vehicle miles driven per year (3.26 trillion last year vs. 2.57 trillion in 1998).\n"

Older Scandinavian people tend to talk a lot about not wanting to be a burden to their family,  and they're usually pretty sincere about it. There is no cultural expectation that your kids and grandkids should take care of you when you're old. I like to think of it as a \"pay it forward\" rather than \"pay it back\" approach. Prioritize your kids, not your parents, is how older people often see things. And I think we're generally happy to spend money on the welfare state because we do want everyone to be taken care of. We just don't want to do it ourselves!\n\nScandinavian culture is also really focused on personal independence, so we'd rather leave the state in charge of caring for people than do it ourselves. We all have more personal freedom this way. For the most part this system works, but I completely understand why foreigners sometimes find us cold.\n"

				"Comment": "My theory is that if you gave people in developing countries resources and wealth like developed ones, that hospitality would disappear.\n\nWhen there is a major natural disaster in any American state, you see a community come together. Tornadoes that devastate a city will bring people that normally don't hang out or even like each other work together to survive. There are plenty of news stories out there that show heart warming images of people handing out food or providing a blanket to someone that needs it.\n\nWhat you don't see is the lack of that community once things are back to normal.\n\nWhen you need people and resources just to survive, you naturally form community. It's human nature. When you have everything you need, your community is only the people immediately around you (friends/family).\n\nI experienced this myself after the George Floyd protests. I went to help in some cleanup the day after one of the big looting nights in South Minneapolis. As I walked down one of the main streets, there were businesses handing out free food, people playing music, the local Target temporarily being converted to a food shelf, and so many people out cleaning that I actually didn't really get to do much work at all. George Floyd Square was full of people visiting for most that summer, despite covid.\n\nNow? People constantly complain online that George Floyd Square needs to get shut down (it's still been operating on a volunteer basis since 2020 and I drive through it all the time). Businesses on that main street have closed, some places have been vacant since the protests, and there isn't that sense of community anymore. It's back to being your typical segregated Minneapolis area.\n\nAnd what I have done since the protests? Nothing. I'm part of the problem. I still follow GFS on social media and keep telling myself I'm going to donate some clothes to their \"people's closet\", but have I done that since 2020? No. Have I donated any more money to the rebuilding effort that is still ongoing? No. Have I even visited GFS since 2020 (not counting driving past it)? No. Have I engaged with anyone I normally wouldn't in that community since the protests? Nope. My partner and a friend of mine lives in South, and those are the only people I hang out with. People are still in need in that area, and I've done nothing now that I feel safe again.\n"

It might also be skewed by the fact that people from rich countries can go to a poor country and think the middle-class family that invited them to dinner is poor, and poor people are actually making a sacrifice by sharing the little they have. Most poor countries are filled with corruption and many communities are often hostile because life there is a rat race. Many places that are unsafe for locals might be ok for tourists because local criminals don't want to risk killing tourist industry.  \n\nSure, you go to a poor village in my country (which isn't that poor) and you might end up getting invited to family dinners, and everyone will be warm and friendly. Next time you visit they will offer you free lodging and food, etc. The people will look like a nice community where neighbors help each other. But the mayor is corrupt and steals all the funding, and if you aren't friends with the right people they will turn on you and treat you like shit. If you try to build a house someone will constantly steal the materials overnight. If you moved there permanently you'd get to see the real situation, which wouldn't be nice.\n"

If you are a certain ethnicity in a particular place, people will ignore you even if you starve. And if you are slightly well off/middle class, all your other relatives will try to leech off of you. Not to mention, one common thing is when a parent dies, siblings fight a lot over division of property, even bribing officials to steal their sister's share. Of course scams and all happen in rich countries too. But I just don't like how poor countries are glorified as places where people are just selfless when that is not the reality.\n"

There was an omnipresent humming from all of the central air conditioning units though.  Also, if you walked through there instead of driving, you'd get suspicious looks.

The dogs barking nonstop.  The two-stroke motorcycle chain-saw engines buzzing by every few minutes.  The honking.  The rumbling or idling trucks.  The chickens crowing.  The children playing.  Your neighbor's stereo.  Your neighbor's karaoke machine.  Your neighbor's screaming baby.  And of course there are the once-a-month parties at one of the nearby pavilions or restaurants or banquet halls that blast their music until 3 a.m., or the nearby basketball court with the teams playing the nighttime games and the crowds cheering, and a PA system with a screaming announcer, or the nearby school in the daytime with the kids outside screaming and singing and the PA system with the shouting teacher.\n\nAnd always the barking dogs.\n\nYou don't adjust to that.

He died in 2015 with a MBA. After moving to the US as a teen, he always sent his aging mother money to take care of her, but in my childhood, he ended up moving his immediate family across the US to get away from ALL of the others because he was tired of \"the societal pressure\" to take care of everyone but his own immediate family.\n\nMy maternal grandfather died last month and I flew back across the country for his death and funeral.  My mom was one of eight.  Same thing. It was beautiful seeing them all, but I can 💯 understand why we moved 2500 miles across the country to get away from their expectations. One of my cousins who I hadn't spoken to in over a decade since we were children called me out of the blue a couple years back, and after 10-15 minutes of catching up, hit me up for money... Even though I told him that I had just had my first child who was born 16 weeks early, had spent 3 months in the NICU, and we were obviously dealing with mountains of child related expenses.

I try to keep a sense of humor about it, because if I couldn't find a way to laugh at it or poke fun at it, or otherwise took it too seriously, I'd drive myself insane by just harping on it and being overly critical of myself. Which, I guess, could just lead me back to drinking to ward off those thoughts.\n\nSo there's my uncalled-for life story! It really had nothing to do with parasites.\n"

				"Comment": "This is actually my field of expertise. I have a PhD in behavioral nutrition. Part of my focus is on how cultural and economic situations affect the diet of people. \n\nYou are actually completely wrong. 100% reverse of reality. Poor countries typically have a much worse diet and eat far less healthy foods because cheap calories are typically in the form of low quality carbohydrates. Particularly wheat and rice. Rice is in particular very unhealthy. Some studies even show it's worse per calorie for you than pure refined table sugar. Some countries with a large population and relatively little wealth such as India eat some of the worst food of any modern human. A common meal is fried flour with sugar and white rice. \n\nThe wealthy or the country the more nutritious the diet is. The effects of this diet are more my field of study, but the overall nutrition of somebody's diet decreases as your economic status decreases.\n\nEven the way food is prepped is much worse in poor countries. Frying food is actually more common in poor countries than rich ones. That is because oil is relatively cheap per calorie and a convenient way to cook food.\n"

While I am not sure about other countries, the FDA in the US defines it as any food that has been changed from its natural state. An apple is unprocessed, a cup of cut apple is processed, as are home cooked grains or meats, homemade bread, etc. What people think of when they think unprocssed food is really less processed food.\n"

While obviously kids can be dipshits (me included) it doesn't give adults carte blanche to steamroll over absolutely every little thing. \n\nAlso, being neuro divergent and needing explanations for \"why\" and being met with \"I'm the parent and I said so\" as the only reason just caused so much more strife. Or \"don't talk back/you're being disrespectful\" for trying to get clarity on something. \n\nSame age btw. My mom did better than most, but she was so stressed out when I was younger and didn't have great parental modeling herself so there were definitely times that could have been handled better. And if I try to bring things up now I get met with resistance/amnesia and weird apologies \"I don't remember it that way/I'm sorry you feel that way\" stuff.\n\nThe ax forgets, the tree remembers.\n\nWhats kind of sad is the pendulum has swung way far the other way and so many children today get absolutely no boundaries or consequences because the parents are those children who don't want to be assholes to their kids. The behaviors in school is insane because of this. I wish everyone could just like, fairly and moderately parent gently, instead of being either doormats or drill sergeants.\n"

They’re the ones that never want to leave, ask if they can stay for dinner, sleep over etc and the parents never once check up on them or seem to care if they’re okay. I had one girl and her two baby sisters for an entire day, I asked her a few hours in where her parents were, weren’t they worried? When the baby needed their diaper changed, I sort of freaked out in my head but she changed her sister by herself. I knew then that SHE was the mother, and the actual mother was a sorry excuse for one. I ended up letting them stay for about a week, she got the chance to be a kid and I reinforced the idea that I didn’t want any more babies lol. I couldn’t imagine screaming at my child that they’re a burden. I have twins, and let me tell you, there were some TRYING A$$ moments lol, but they were never a burden. We choose to have them.\n"

So she just works then goes home and sits on her couch watching TV all evening and almost all weekend. \n\nShe rarely cleans up after herself because ‘Jesus will give me the motivation when he thinks I’m ready’. If she’s not watching TV she’s in church. \n\nShe has a shopping addiction and buys new shoes and clothing weekly because ‘Jesus wants me to have new things’. \nShe has shrines in every room of her house of the Virgin Mary. \n\nYeah, we don’t hang out with her much if at all. She’s just too much for everyone, even the people in our group who are religious. Which works out because she’s too busy doing what Jesus wants her to do. \n\nIt’s totally freaking nuts.\n"

Some people are straight up unwilling to comply with this request... they just keep on touching the people around them in this overly familiar way. People who can't regulate their hugging usually can't regulate all kinds of shit. One place where I spent a lot of time had to ban an aggressive hugger who was clearly using it for this weird faux-friendly physical intimidation... when we did that we realized he'd been fucking with people in all sorts of weird ways\n"

For a brief moment I thought there might be something else in the nicely wrapped Pringles can. Maybe she was just using it as a frugal container for something better, but my little brother opened his first and there it was. We got Pringles. Something you may not know about Pringles, they are not up to the rigors of the trans continental journey that our postal system has to offer. There was no Pringleness left in them by the time they got here, just dust. My brothers and I all got cans of powdered Pringles for Christmas.\n\nIt's wonderful getting old because now that doesn't even come close to the worst gift I've received.\n"

I told him to look at the address to mail it in (something like 1225 Jingle Way, North Pole). He didn’t listen and was taking about all the things he was going to do with the money. He finally looked and said, “oh. Huh.” And made a face of disappointment I won’t soon forget. \n\nI still feel like a Class A asshole twenty years later.\n"

Assuming you’ve won an amount with 10, 9, or even 8 figures, you go straight to your nearest major metropolitan city, straight to the biggest law firm in said city, and ask to speak to their top attorney who deal with trusts and estates. Make sure you record the conversation. And ask to have another attorney, preferably an equity partner, present in the room. \n\nAnywhere you go, the ticket stays in a pouch around your neck. Very important that you don’t sign the ticket, but do take several photos and a video of you with the ticket and email them to yourself before you leave. \n\nAfter that, the trust you’ve set up, not you, cashes in the ticket. You get to remain totally anonymous. Once you have everything else in place (hiring one of the big 4 accounting firms, drawing up a new will), only then do you decide who in your life to tell, if anyone.\n\nBad things happen to people who win big jackpots. Best case scenario for most is going bankrupt. Your chance of being murdered or overdosing go up way higher than normal. Do everything you can to minimize those outcomes before you actually get the money.\n"

I did my 20 years also. I’ve been considering fighting again but so scared to poke the bear as if I lose any more I literally will lose everything. My wife can’t work due to my son having a disability. I’m just glad to be alive to spend time around the ones I love. Enough bitching from me friend. Happy Holidays! 😀\n"

The admin runs courses on how to increase, and she herself takes ppl on to help, w a fee of course. The lady who helped me charged me some of my back pay, but it was worth it. She got SHIT DONE. You are NOT POKING THE BEAR AND IT SADDENS/ANGERS ME YOU ENDURED SO MUCH AND ARE NOT BEING COMPENSATED!!!!!!! You are NOT bitching. You are apart of the 1% who served this country and should get every fucking cent you deserve. If you’re interested in the lady who helped me info lmk. You deserve it ALL.

These laptops are for day use or for travel purposes but this guy always got away with keeping the laptop for a long time. We did yearly inventory so he had to bring it in once a year for us to eyeball or he would get charged for it. When he finally brings it in, it had missing keys and the power cable was frayed. It was scuffed up and had cookie crumbs in the keyboard. \n\nThe facility manager told the guy, \"You need to stop having your kids use the check out laptop.\" The professor swore up and down he didn't let his early elementary kids use it. I pop open the disc drive and find a DVD of a popular kids movie. They guy said nothing for a bit and promised to do better keeping the kids away from the laptop. (He didn't)\n\nWe still weren't able to ban the guy from checking out laptops. (I think he traveled a lot) We just made sure he got the same one each time to limit the physical abuse to one machine.\n\n(This was over fifteen years ago, so tablets weren't a thing and laptops were still a large ticket item)\n"

During the meetings, they'd roll up a cigarette, smoke, and exhale the smoke straight into the screen.\n\nIt smelled like \"heavy smoke.\" \"Light smoke\" is like a \"light twang\" of cig smell.

The power connector is loose so somebody likely tripped over the cord and tore the post. It was an easy enough fix to solder it back on but holy fuck was the inside of that thing every nasty.\nI've dealt with regular smokers PC's and those are bad but this guy must have been smoking dope like a fiend whenever he was home. The guts of the laptop were covered in sticky THC residue and smelled like I was standing next to Snoop Dog. The fan was caked and encrusted. Everything was yellow with bits and pieces of whatever adhered to the sticky resin bits.\n\nI have no idea how much dope somebody needs to smoke next to a laptop to get things like that within just a few months but I can only imagine what the inside of that dude's lungs were like.\n"

Basically I pick them up after they get returned to the IT department, so I guess I'm in this category. School laptops are always dirty as hell, keys caked in dirt clearly, they've never heard of Windex. \n\nTeachers almost always its covered in coffee. One time they had those cheap plastic MacBook covers on and they must have just left it sitting in the coffee for weeks because it dried all over the outer case and I'm not talking like thin layer of coffee I'm talking THICK layer. Tablets and phones usually have expanded or exploded batteries to the point the screens popped off the case.\n\nAs for computer cases they rarely ever clean out the inside. Worst one was from a spice company we pickup from and it had dust and cinnamon (at least it smelled like cinnamon) caked up on the bottom higher than the size of my fist so about 5 inches high. Also had cases that looked like they just dropped it down a flight up steps, walked down picked it up, then walked back to the top to repeat the process 5 more time.\n"

The nails actually wear a groove in the keys. There are a few keys I strike with my nail (like the T key) and there's a visible groove there on keyboards that I use for any length of time.\n\nOn my first keyboard at this company, I literally wore a hole through the T key. Like you could see through the key into the internals. (I wish I had popped that key off when I switched keyboards and kept it as a souvenir.)\n"

So the sales guy is showing it to a client and he's pretty impressed, and the dipshit owner walks up and decides to get involved.  He was notorious for his ego and getting in the way.  \n\nThe client says, \"I bet that thing can shred just about anything,\" and while yes it can, we only threw hard drives in it to not mess it up.  The owner goes, \"oh yeah it's great on laptops and sees a laptop sitting by the conveyer belt and just chucks the fucking thing in.  The teeth instantly catch it and it's gone in like 5 seconds.  \n\nIt was the clients work laptop, the diphsit owner just assumed it was one the hundreds or recycled laptops we have in the warehouse.  The client was fucking livid, yelling at the owner and asking why he would just grab anyones laptop and proceed to throw it in.  The owners ego kicks in and he says something dumb like \"We don't allow other peoples property in the warehouse and everything else in the warehouse I OWN.\" \n\nBut the best part was the client called back later that day and said his IT department didn't believe him, so we had to dig out what we could that resembled a laptop and throw it in a box and send it back to him.  The other best part is the custom shredder is in a trailer with it's own CCTV system, so we had it all on tape.  The warehouse manager would play that shit all the time to make us laugh.\n"

I don't know if he was clumsy or just had a bad temper, or stored it on a rope dragging behind his car, or what.  All I know is, every 6 months we issued the guy a new laptop and the destroyed ones became parts machines or, occasionally I was able to fix it up enough to issue to someone else.  If he was anything lower than a director level employee he would have been told deal with it for 3 years until you're due for an upgrade.\n"

Nearly monthly - sometimes more - he'd stop by my office and tell me, \"the Chinesium keyboard broke again.\" His words, I'm just repeating the term here. \n\nSo I'd go over to his cube which was a fucking crime scene. His keyboard was basically filled with fuzz from the mold growing on all the drippings of food he'd spill into it.  It literally looked like that one \"battlestation\" photo from the 1990s.  You know the one I'm talking about. \n\nAnd yes, every month - sometimes more - I'd have to swap his keyboard for a fresh one.  After the first time I started wearing gloves. He'd just stand there and watch me swap it.  He probably got off on the power trip of making me have to do that.  Fucking scumbag.\n"

Seriously security right. I am talking to the it guys and taking back off laptop. When the backs come off they pop off when I did this a bunch of stuff came out as well and was airborne. We all hit the ground, why well it was the DOJ and normally stuff does not come out. Turns out after we look that it’s coffee grounds. Like what??? Fresh not brewed grounds all over the damn thing in everything. The head IT guy heard us yell and came out. Looks we realize we laugh, except him. He proceeds to go to an office slam the door shut and we hear yelling. I guess this user was on laptop 3 at this point and had also damaged the last 2 laptops in weird incidents. Had another guy tell me a bear stepped on it. Really people just tell your on-site tech the truth lol\n"

Lady brought in her laptop covered in pee because she got drunk at a party and thought it would be funny to do. Problem 1. we could smell it, problem 2 half of our guys were at the party. Warranty coverage denied, and she had to buy a new laptop to continue classes. They were $1500 each at the time.\n\nAlso had a guy with severe dandruff that would come in. It would get in through the keyboard, clog up the motherboard/fans, and it would overheat. They helped him 4 times before telling him if he comes in again with dandruff damage they are cancelling his warranty outright.\n"

The album has a suite style arrangement for side 1 where every song runs directly into the next.  Side 2 is long form soul jams which conclude with a reprise of the opening track to tie the whole album together.  Every track is about something that was plaguing society, especially the black community.  As far as I’m aware, it’s the first and only time a soul musician attempted something like this, and it’s brilliant.\n"

I've always considered him a musical genius and he was always on my list of people I needed to see, but never did.\n\nI often say, the key to knowing modern music is to know/listen to the music others are into.\n\nPrince always believed that too, and because of it. That is how I discovered Joni Mitchell because Prince was so into her.\n"

				"Comment": "Maiden is my favorite band, Powerslave is my favorite album by Maiden, but Flash of the Blade and The Dualists drop it JUST a hair below Somewhere in Time on my actual \"best\" Maiden album list. \n\nPowerslave is still my personal favorite though because the pure power of Aces High, Two Minutes, the title track and of course their second best song Rime (behind only my favorite song of all time Hallowed Be Thy Name), is a little better than Wasted Years, Sea Of Madness, Stranger in a Strange Land and Alexander The Great. \n\nEither way can't go wrong. Two monster albums, incredible era for the band and maybe my two favorite album covers ever. (I still have flags of both in a bin that used to be in my university apartment bedroom)\n\nAnd by the way. My two absolute 10/10s are Master of Puppets and Rush's Hemispheres.\n"

I am absolutely shocked that it was barely discussed during the pandemic. Not one single \"natural method\" will cure Covid19, but if you combine Vitamin D, Vitamin C, zinc, sulfur, capsaicin, aerobic exercise, healthy BMI amongst other things... combined with modern marvels of medicine (such as vaccines) it would have definitely made a difference.\n"

No ill will against the people asking this, its a normal question with no malice. They had no idea. But that was difficult.\n"

It’s a tale as old as time; neglect and irresponsibility persist. Even my uncle got fucked over by this reality when he found a stray cat. ‘Happy hour’ they said, but really, it’s a serious issue that needs attention. Adopt, don’t shop, and spay or neuter your pets.\n"

				"Comment": "That’s why some professions that require extensive training and certifications keep the numbers of new individuals trained artificially low, instead of expanding programs to meet demand. Med schools and residency spots are probably the most well known occurrences, as increasing the number of residency slots in a given specialty requires approval from various medical licensing boards, all of which have an incentive to keep the number of practitioners smaller and thus ensure salaries stay larger.\n"

If anything I could imagine demand may go up when times are tough, because people will fix old “broken” cars rather than buy new ones. People might scrimp and save and stuff, or go without their car for a few weeks while they save up, or even get a car repossessed or sell one they can’t fix, but sooner or later the car is gonna get fixed up and back on the road, and a recession won’t make it more likely to get scrapped. Good answer.\n"

At my work they instituted furloughs to deal with the revenue deficit caused by the Great Recession. Basically I was forced to take one unpaid day off of work. \n\nThey also made us do that at the beginning of 2021 for 6 months but then paid it back because the State didn't lose as much money during the lockdown as anticipated. Thanks to the Federal government.\n"

Taxi dropped me off with my luggage on the side of the road at midnight, refused to go any further. Hotel is two miles up the road. I'm in front of some random farm. Me walking woke their six pit bulls up and they start chasing me.\n\nFamily comes out. Mom, dad, two uncles, six kids. They ask what the fuck I'm doing out there. I speak limited Spanish, they speak no English. They call their sister in law, who's in New York.\n\nTurns out the area I'm in is one of the most dangerous stretches of road for miles. So bad they refuse to give me a ride to the hotel at night, and refuse to let me walk it. These angels let me head closer to their house so I can bum off their wifi since I have zero signal, and wait for my hotel to answer.  In the meantime, they have the uncles stand by the road with machetes, just so we don't get robbed while we talk. Hotel doesn't answer.\n\nSo, I'm offered a bed and a meal. By these complete strangers, mind you. I'm a bit flustered, but say yes. Whole time aunty on the phone is offering me assurances, these are good people. Here's my info, contact your family in the states to confirm who I am. It'll be okay, we won't let you get hurt.\n\nHotel finally responds just as they're helping me move my bags inside. Expected pickup in thrity minutes. Change of plans, stand with the gringa with machetes (the two uncles) and a shotgun (dad) while we wait. Dogs let me pet them. Kids are starting a soccer match.\n\nForty five minutes later, seal team six shows up. Six big, buff, burly men with shotguns and machetes pull up, plates match what the hotel gave me. Family won't let me go without double checking everything. Turns out it really was a bad area. I owe those people my life.\n"

I looked outside and saw these two massive dogs attacking a little dog who was being walked by its owner.\nI ran into my garage and grabbed a big ass broom and just started wailing on the pitbull who had the poor little dog in its mouth. The pit dropped the dog and both it and the rottweiler started paying attention to me. I just shouted as loud as I could and kept pushing the broom towards them, the rottweiler took off and the pit watched and left as well...\nThe woman walking the little dog scooped it up and ran away...there was blood everywhere on the street and pavement. \nI called the police and they took a statement. I was full of adrenaline, didn't realize the gravity of it until afterwards.\nTurns out the offending dogs got out of a yard across the street, the owner got fined and put up a new fence eventually.\nA few days later a case of beer shows up on my porch, it was from the attacked dogs owner. She had contacted the police to see who helped her dog. The dog survived after surgery. I still think about them.\n"

As I was loading bags into the trunk a homeless man (maybe late 20s) asked if I would give him a couple dollars If he put my bags in my trunk. I said no, he doesn’t need to help me (I was also terrified of strangers touching ANYTHING of mine) but I said I’ll buy him groceries . He seemed confused so I explained again “I’ll finish loading my bags while you go pick out some food— I’ll meet you inside when I’m done and I’ll pay”. \n\nHe thanked me a bunch of times and went inside to buy his stuff. When I walked inside to pay as promised, I saw he only bought a box of cereal , some bread, and a small juice. I told him to go back and get more. He was hesitant at first but ultimately I bought him about $50 worth of groceries, and also gave him some disposable gloves, masks , and trash bags from my car. He must have thanked me 1,000 times.\n"

My boss would always just throw the old ones away until I decided to start selling them after I  fix them up as a little side hustle.\n\nWell, my elderly neighbor had recently had her husband pass away, and had fallen down  and broken her hip.  She was in a rehab facility and they weren't going to let her come home because of the conditions of her house.  So, I volunteered to clean it all for her.  I couldn't believe it when I saw it.  \n\nThere was about two inches of mouse shit everywhere but the walking paths through the house.  No furnace, no working stove, nothing...  I guess she had a lot of sight loss and needed Lasik but couldn't get an appointment to get the needed referral for medi-cal to pay for it.  I cleaned that place spotless and luckily, was able to give her a working stove, washer, and furnace I had taken home from my construction job.  I even repiped the entire place because the pvc pipes were in such bad condition.  Then when she got out, I called my bishop who is an optometrist and he came that day after work and wrote her the referral to get Lasik.  I remember after she got the Lasik I went over to check on her and she was making dinner and she said something akin to it being the first time in a decade that she could actually see the food she was cooking and use the stove at all.  I was so happy to have helped.  She passed away a few years ago, but she did so living in her home watching the televangelists she loved so much.  Miss you, Nikki!\n"

I did nothing at first, hoping he’d clear it, but he stood up and started turning blue. I stood up, got behind him, was just able to grasp my hands together around his trunk and started trying to administer the Heimlich maneuver. The second try dislodged whatever he was choking on. It looked like meat and rice. His wife stood up crying, and started calling me her Christmas miracle. \n\nWe were at a restaurant a half block from Lona Linda Hospital, and there were at least half a dozen medical staff in scrubs also eating. No one else did anything to help. I’m guessing they were afraid of the potential liability issues.\n"

I was pretty drunk as well until adrenalin kicked in when I realised I should do whatever I can for this girl. She fell of her bike and was crying real bad. Checked for injuries, nothing too serious besides a bloody nose. We gently turned her on her side just in case she would throw up and might choke on it. Her friends did not want to call her mother because she could get in trouble for being drunk. I convinced her friend to call anyway or I would call emergency services. Just wanted to make sure she was going to be safe. And I comforted her and said everything is gonna be ok. Took off my coat and tried to keep her warm and as comfortable as possible til her mom came by to pick her up. This was in the middle of a cold december night. I felt real bad for her and I was glad I could make a difference. There were many times I helped out complete strangers but this was one of the most fulfilling for me.\n"

While there, there was a family of both mom and dad and four kids that were out of gas and somewhat stranded with no food to feed the kids.  During that stop I didn’t do anything to help them but went on back to work.  From my desk at work I could see the family sitting there, not many people were stopping to help.  Things got the better of me and so I called my wife and told her the situation.  She met me at work and we went over to where they were and talked to them a bit to see what was up and what we could do to help.  They told us the dad had lost his job and they were moving to California where they had family, they literally had nothing.  There was a Comfort Inn right next door so we rented them a room for the night, we took them to Walmart to buy necessities and food to feed them all for several days.  We filled up their van with gas and gave them enough gas money to reach California.  About a week later we got a letter in the mail from them, post marked California saying they had arrived and they were very thankful for our help.  Sure they could have taken advantage of us, but that wasn’t the case this time.\n"

Anyway, a friggin deer leaps out and hauls ass across 4 lanes of traffic. I'm pretty surprised because I didn't even know we had deer in town. Then I saw the most joyously oblivious husky come running after it. He just runs right across all 4 lanes of traffic and he's lucky to have survived that much but he lost sight of the deer and you could tell he was just going to keep running in and out of traffic until he found it or got run over so I called him over and kind of negotiated getting close to him until I could get a hand on his collar. I walked him back the direction he came from until I found a young lady who was missing a dog and I headed home. \n\nThe whole thing took like 10 minutes and wasn't terribly difficult but if nobody stopped for him there's a decent chance he would have died. It would have been a huge deal if somebody had done it for me and my dog so I'm pretty proud of it.\n"

And it was his wife that suggested that his death could just have been a dream. \n\nSince his action career didnt even get started, he agreed to return. Having some story lines that asked for some action for him to do. \n\nNot only did Duffy coming back put a lot of people out of work on Dallas, it also caused problems for the spin off show, Knots Landing. See the writers of Dallas didnt tell the writers of Knots Landing what they were planning. And since they shared a connected universe, it pissed them off so much that instead of trying to work it out they just \"fuck you\" never mentioned Bobby again in any of their scripts.\n"

But it wasnt detrimental to the ratings either as the audience wasnt really that invested in Pams new love, Mark. So they didnt even bother to revisit the sotry line of him coming back after he vanished. So him just being gone was fine. Other plot points that were washed away included a bomb going off at Ewing oil. \n\nWhen it came back the next season it was like that season just never happened and it picked up story lines that had been resolved but changed them. All but one. There was a guest star, Steve Forrest, who was playing a character that was maybe or maybe not Miss Ellies husband who had died years before. The story line was reintroduced with the same actor but with a different name. \n\nAlso, one of the actresses had been killed off in a car bomb during the dream season, so she had to come back. Only to be killed off again in a mountain climbing accident lol.\n"

				"Comment": "Some shows I think fit:\n\nA Different World - Bill Cosby’s crimes changed A Cosby Show from beloved to remembered for the wrong reasons, but people seem to forget the spin-off was massive and was actually second only to the Cosby Show itself in the ratings its first year.\n\nHome Improvement - Sitcoms ruled the 90s, and this show was just as big as Seinfeld and Friends. But while those shows are both still culturally relevant and streaming hits, nobody cares about this show at all now. Tim Allen is more remembered for Santa Clause and Toy Story.\n\nDynasty - People remember Dallas, but Dynasty actually surpassed it popularity for a bit, and it was the #1 show in TV at one point.\n\nWithout a Trace - After CSI popularized the crime scene investigation procedural, there was a massive influx. Some also became binge shows people remember like NCIS, but Without a Trace was a top 10 hit for multiple seasons and nobody seems to remember it even in comparison to shows it was a bigger hit than like Bones.\n\nThen there’s just all the other random 90’s sitcoms that were actually massive top 10 hits but didn’t have the impact of Friends, Seinfeld, Will & Grace, and so on. Veronica’s Closet, Suddenly Susan, Major Dad, Grace Under Fire, Coach, and so on.\n"

But a lot of that was due to the AIDS crisis radically shifting public perception of sexuality across the 80s, and the showrunners constantly fighting the network over the matter. Its heart was in the right place, basically, and it tried its best in a decade that turned very anti-gay just a couple years into its run.\n\nBut yeah, nobody else seems to remember it any more.\n"

And it was ALSO a super rare show from the era to have running arc storylines across seasons. It even used non-standard camerawork, like handheld cameras.\n\nBasically, HSB laid the groundwork for every serious/gritty cop show to follow for the next several decades, like The Wire and soforth. But no one ever talks about HSB any more, even though it ran for something like seven years and was incredibly popular.\n"

Plus something about killing his beloved brother and nephew because girl power. It was just emblematic of things to come.\n\nThere were problems in earlier seasons but the problem was D&D took the wrong message and themes (not just for book reports) from the books. Yea the world is dark and people do terrible things. But the people who are righteous, even if they don’t succeed, are ultimately vindicated. Book Ned was merciful not because he was dumb but because he refused to endanger children. That’s why the North rallied to rescue “Arya” from the Boltons while a man like Tywin has his legacy fall apart the moment he dies.\n\nBut the show wound up with this “might makes right” theme. And also with the idea that any woman must be a cold jerk because that’s strength and compassion (as book Sansa or Sam or Davos) shows is weakness.\n"

But I see the way those ended as likely very close to what GRRM told them. Dany's actions in King's Landing were predicted in early seasons in a vision. Jaime going back to the worst woman in the world sounds exactly like the kind of tragedy that gets GRRMs jimmies rustling.\n\nThe problem is they couldn't seem to tell these stories properly. The audience failed to buy it.\n\nAs for the whole Night King thing. I feel like there's a whole lot left out that made people think it was dumb. It's made clear in an earlier season that a Weir Tree can block the power to resurrect the dead. Bran under the tree is the bait that forces the Night King to approach to deal with him. Arya is the trap. A hidden blade sent overseas years ago and trained as an assassin. It's implied that a god or some greater force has been moving them all into this position. Perhaps the role of many of these pieces was to be sacrificed (such as the Dothraki and Theon) to help draw in the Night King to the trap.\n\nYou could totally make all of this make sense, and it seems like the threads are there to do so... but they just didn't.\n"

She was going to have a shower, put the water as hot as she could to get started quickly, stepped into the bathtub, and had an epileptic fit that lasted for 45 minutes. The bathtub was filled with extremely hot water, and she was almost boiled alive.\nShe came out of it with third degree burns on 53% of her body, and we were first told that they did not know if they could save her life, and if they did, it was unsure whether she would get to keep her hands and her feet. She was kept in a medically induced coma for a while, and then they transplanted all available unharmed skin on to the parts which were burned. I could not hold her hands, I could not give her a proper hug. I could only hold my cheek carefully against her left cheek, which was the only part which was neither burnt nor skinned.\nBut on Christmas Eve, they had saved her life, and they had saved her hands and her feet. She was allowed to come out of the hospital for a few hours in a wheelchair, to have Christmas dinner with us.\nWhen she arrived she opened out her arms and gave me a big hug. The first real hug since the accident.\nAnd that hug was the best Christmas present ever.\n"

But I was nowhere near exhausted as the families gathered by each bedside to hold their holiday vigil. By the time I finished updating them all, putting in orders, reviewing labs and CT scans, writing notes, and fiddling with knobs and gauges, it was 4 pm. After the 20 minute drive home there was just time enough to fling a hoverboard each with ribbon and bow at my niece and nephew before the phone rang. It was my partner on-call at the hospital.\n"

I tried to rub vinegar and oil all over his skin to make them go away, but that just irritated his skin even more. He got into his angry mood where he screens “whooop” every 5 seconds. \n\nI thought I could calm him down by throwing him in the pool. I thought he was just joking when he was flailing about in the pool. I forgot he couldn’t swim. My mom came outside to hear what was going on and became furious with me. Needless to say I got in a lot of trouble.\n"

This is in the case of diplomacy and military alliances, which was most evident during First World War when Austria-Hungary attempted to conquer Serbia which triggered the alliances with Russia, France and Great Britain on one side and Germany with Austria on other. The result was the end of Austria-Hungary as an unified state.\nAlso geographical advantage plays key role, Switzerland was saved from two world wars because of its position in Alps which makes a hell of a lot hard work for conquering army compared to what it would gain.\nAnother way is modernizing your army to the enemy level fast enough, that is how Ethiopia avoided colonization by Italy with modern rifles and cannons.\n"

And buying cars are highly discouraged. Future plan is to allow every household to \nbe within 10 mins of walking distance to a train station. \n\nHDB: the lack of land has >90% of households living in apartments. We also have very low percentage of homelessness because it’s easy to cater HDB flats to low income families. Buying land in Singapore is extremely expensive due to its scarcity and most of it belongs to the government which they use to build our HDB flats also known as public housing. \n\nLow crime rate: Partly due to the distance and also there are CCTVs everywhere. It is often boasted that as long as the criminal is still in Singapore, the justice system should be able to catch them within 48hours. \n\nGood healthcare. Due to the distance as well. Rarely do we need to use airlifts to transport patients. There is also mandatory healthcare insurance that all Singaporeans need to have which we can use our Medisave to pay. Medisave is part of CPF(a countrywide mandatory saving plan that takes 20% of our salary to put into saving for retirement). Also as hospitals are close by, there are no home births or birth centres. All pregnant women should give birth in the hospital this excellent healthcare and low infant mortality. Should also mention that most hospitals are located within walking distance of of train stations for easy access to healthcare facilities.\n"

Our government was also very corrupt a dozen years ago.\n\nWe also have a very peculiar government system, not with a president but with two Captain Regents changed every six months, and we've had the first gay Head of State in the world, despite not having LGBTQ+ friendly laws yet.\n\nLaws, propositions and new things can be done easier and quicker than big countries, but that's not necessairly positive. Fascism affirmed easily due to this (my reat grandfather worked for the fascist government for example), and we had the only communist government in western Europe after WWII, for 12 years.\n"
