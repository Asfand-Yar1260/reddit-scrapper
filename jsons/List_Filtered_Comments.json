It was one of the most unrealistic bullshit advice I've ever heard and made me want to blow my brains out. It genuinely worried me as to how many upvotes that comment got.

It breaks your confidence in your own experience and your ability to think for yourself in a major way. \n\nI remember when every online argument became \"gaslighting\" and I was so mad about it. \n\nGaslighting is when I was told my literal pain was just me pretending to get attention, that my memory of physical abuse was made up so I can be lazy, that my memory of SA was just me trying to get away from my step dad because I hate responsibility, etc. until I believed it so fully that I ended up in inpatient care thinking I was unforgivable for being so manipulative and attention seeking. \n\nIt's not when someone doesn't agree with you ffs.\n",

Narcissists are INCAPABLE OF FEELING REMORSE. They are basically sociopaths. That's a pretty serious accusation to make without significant evidence to back it up.\n\nSo many stupid Facebook memes going around like \"if your partner ever makes you feel bad it could be a sign that they're a narcissist.\" No bitch, if your partner is a chronic liar and manipulator who never regrets hurting others it's a sign that they're a narcissist. My narcissistic ex literally had an entire secret family and saw nothing wrong with this because \"you wouldn't have gone out with me if I told you.\" There is such a massive gap between typical relationship problems and narcissistic abuse, they aren't even comparable.\n",

Okayyyy but then what’s an appropriate balance then? Should actors only date actors? What if one actor gets more popular during the relationship and thus gets more influence? Do they have to break up now? Are directors only allowed to date directors? Do the same popularity surge rules apply? \n\nIn the real world with the laymen, I’ve actually seen people on this app say that when a husband was promoted at his job (a job that the wife was not at), that became a power imbalance and it was time to end it. And they were not trolling. And were not downvoted. How…how does that work…?\n",

They are so quick to judge someone's relationship they are willing to completely remove any agency of the person they perceive as the 'lesser' partner. It's one thing to criticise a power imbalance between a young teen and someone older, but they seem to want to extend childhood into the mid thirties.\n\nAt 18 someone can join the army and fight for their country, take out a mortgage or enter into a contract, but the second they enter a relationship with someone outside some arbitrary acceptable range they are suddenly completely incapable of making an informed decision. If that person then argues their case that they are quite happy with their choice of partner, then that gets used as evidence of 'grooming'.\n\nI'm pretty sure it reflects a lack of life experience and an inability to look outside their own idealised narrow echo chamber of opinion.\n",

Is it dumb? Yes. Is the dog thrilled by it? Probably not. Is it grotesque animal abuse? No. \n\nBut Reddit will treat you like you throw puppies in a river, it’s bizarre.\n",

I have to have the majority of my time spent alone or I feel exhausted. \n\nI am also very popular. I get invited out often. I have exactly zero anxiety about public speaking or talking to a stranger. I have zero trouble standing up for myself or confronting problems. \n\nReddit thinks social anxiety and their lack of social skills makes them and introvert.

				"Comment": "The only resume I have thrown right in the proverbial shredder was that of the wife of a friend of mine. I was attempting to get her a job at my employer. She had no degree or relevant experience, but we needed a receptionist, and people commonly move up from those jobs into other admin positions. Plus, it's government work, so good benefits, lots of paid holidays, etc. Bottom line, I was doing this underqualified, unemployed person a massive favor by giving her a reference and a chance. We didn't have any other applicants. The job was hers to lose. She didn't know that, so she brought her A game. Here are some excerpts from her cover letter:\n\n\"I may not have a degree, but I have what engineers don't have, 10 years of experience.\" \n\n\"Engineers aren't very organized people and I can keep them in line.\" \n\n\"I have better social skills than engineers do.\" \n\nI am not paraphrasing. Those are things she wrote when she sent me her resume and cover letter to look over before she submitted them online to apply. I was just like, \"You know I'm an engineer, right?\" She did. I continued, \"You know the job you'd be applying for is a receptionist position, not an engineer position, right?\" She seemed pretty sure she could move up and be an engineer in a year or so. That is not at all a thing in my field (it's one of those fields where everyone is required to be licensed and you have to have a degree in this just to be allowed to take the exam to get the license), but she was absolutely sure it was. \n\nI told her that if she was going to submit this, she wouldn't be hired because the entire panel was engineers. She didn't listen, and submitted it. She even listed me as a reference. I told my boss she was someone I was trying to help and she wouldn't help herself, which was accurate, but \"I've got what engineers don't have, 10 years of experience!\" became the office joke for years to come. Every time someone reached the 10 year mark of their career, we'd be like, \"You can't be an engineer anymore. The crazy lady said 10 years is the limit.\" lol\n",

I mean, that’s ok, but there was no work experience listed for that time period either, soooo. \n\nThen came the interview with my lead technician and me. Walk the guy into a small meeting room and sit down. Before I can even introduce us, he pulls this laminated piece of paper out of his folio slams it down on the table and pushes it across the table and says, “So when do I start?”\n\nThe document was a letter of recommendation from his CC physics teacher. A glowing assessment of the candidate which greatly conflicted with my assessment based on his behavior. \n\nHe did not get the job.\n",

				"Comment": "So I’ve never trashed a resume, but twice in my career I’ve had to make the decision to fire someone during their first week. \n\nFirst was for a customer service representative. The job requirements were fairly simple; good understanding of excel, prior experience with quickbooks (this was at a small business), and bilingual Spanish and English. She said “I’m an expert at excel. I know everything it can do.” First red flag, but I wasn’t in the interview where she said that, so I only found out after the fact. Said she had worked with quickbooks for 5 years at her last job, and grew up in a Spanish speaking household and it was her first language and learned English in school. \n\nCut to the first week; any Spanish callers she would put on hold and make up some excuse of how she was in the middle of something and needed one of the other reps to get it. After a couple of days the other reps realized she couldn’t speak Spanish so they started talking shit about her, in Spanish, in front of her, and when they would laugh, she would laugh along like she understood the joke.  \n\nWhen she did basic onboarding with quickbooks, our accountant said it was like she’s never used any accounting software before, let alone quickbooks. \n\nWhen I was showing her how to use the excel spreadsheets that were built to run all of the order entry, she was flabbergasted by a basic formula that multiplied three fields together. When I told her there’s a vlookup function, she said “oh, I didn’t know I would need to know programming.” (Which by the way, she didn’t need to know it, I was just explaining how it worked. \n\nAnyway, started on Monday, sent packing Friday morning. Any one of those things we might have kept her and let her grow into the role, but she straight up lied about the only three requirements on the posting. Sayonara.\n\nThe second was much more recent; last year in fact. The private equity firm that owns the corporation I work for owns another company on the east coast. They were hit with a ransomware attack and their IT team was completely inept, so the private equity firm contracted our IT team to fly out and help them. One of the things we were going to be doing, aside from remediating the issue, was onboarding their new IT director, getting them familiar with the existing infrastructure (which we were rebuilding for them) and then making clear the expectations around his role and what the board would be wanting from him. \n\nHe showed up on his first day at 10:30AM; we had been there since 7. We talked to him for about 10 minutes; introduced ourselves and talked about which areas of what is now HIS network we were focusing on, and made it clear we would only be in town for three more days before we had to fly back to LA. We said feel free to jump in with any of us and we’ll show you what we’re doing, why it’s important, and how it relates to everything. He proceeded to go to his new office, shut the door (didn’t meet anyone else in the company) and “set up his email” for the rest of the fucking day. Oh, and he left at 3:30. We were there until 7, went to dinner, and then proceeded to continue working until 1AM. We did that every day we were there. Remember, we’re in major crisis mode. The next day he comes in, 10:30 again, and goes straight to his office, closes the door, and said he needed to finish setting up his email. He had one meeting with the CEO, where he only talked about his hobbies, and then left for the day at 2:30. On the third day, he came in, and was fired first thing in the morning. \n\nThe conversation was something like “look man… you have to run this whole operation; we know it right now because we’ve been building it for you. You have no idea how to operate and maintain this when we leave, and you’ve wasted two of our 4 days here doing a task that takes 3 minutes for a level 1 it tech. Hell, you could have TASKED one of your L1 techs to do it for you, so you could do, you know, DIRECTOR shit. But you’re clearly not the right guy for this role, because the right guy would have been in the trenches with us, helping where possible, and learning everything there is to learn.” \n\nKinda felt bad about that one, the guy quit another high paying job to take this one. But man, if you can’t put in effort your first week in the job when the entire company is in a crisis mode and you’ve got contractors on site working 16 hour days… ya… fuck off.\n",

One of my coworkers was doing resume evaluations for our boss and opened the Linktree, finding links to an R-rated Twitter account, a PG-13 Insta, her Onlyfans, and to her content on several other porn sites. My coworker and boss were not amused, and they were debating whether someone was trolling the company or if it was a bizarre spam attempt. Her resume was rejected, and she was sent an automated \"Thank you, good luck in your search, please try again in the future\" email. \n\nA few months later, we were advertising another open entry-level position when her resume came through again. My boss was doing the resume evals and recognized the name. He opened it a second time, while commenting to another of my coworkers about the inappropriate resume (he's not a perv, but was just surprised to see it again.) When my boss clicked the Linktree URL again to show the coworker, he was greeted with a perfectly normal collection of engineering links, including a link to her electronic resume, her LinkedIn, several projects she'd worked on, and a GitHub account. \n\nOur best guess is that the applicant had accidentally copypasted the wrong Linktree URL the first time. She was still rejected for the second position. At that point, several employees had seen everything, and my boss decided that moving her resume forward for interviews would be inappropriate. Bit of a shame too. Solid GPA from a well-respected CS program, interesting projects, and a demonstrated ability to take on some absolutely massive workloads (sorry, I'm weak and couldn't resist.) \n\nWhen applying for a job, please don't include links to your nudes.

With the exception of one visit for a Mother’s Day brunch served buffet style, it was the only dish I ever ordered from the place. \n\nThe last time I visited I didn’t see it on the menu so I asked about it; Not a single employee knew what I was talking about. They brought out the main chef (cook?) who they claimed had been cooking there for years. The man looked at me incredulously and said “we can’t make salad with cooked lettuce, lettuce wilts when heated, it would be no good.” So I googled grilled caesar salad and showed the results to them, they humored me with feigned interest and apologized again and that was the end of it. I had a basic cold Caesar salad with a side of shrimp (B- at best). \n\nTo this day I cannot explain it. It’s my own personal Mandela effect. I wish I was someone who posted pictures of food so I’d have had proof. \n\nLong story to say… yes, this salad is PHENOMENAL.\n",

There are people who keep instant on hand for this, but that rubs me the wrong way. \n\nThe only issue is if you’re doing something that requires little to no water. \n\nA tip (if you want) Coming from chocolate, and now working in coffee: if you have something that has milk/dairy, but cannot handle more moisture than that, I’d steep the milk with some coffee grounds to make it flavoured the way you want it. \n\nPlace I used to work did a “meringue based ice cream” where you can’t add much in the way of liquids other than the cream you add at the end (you fold it in). So we would steep the cream with whatever flavouring (coffee, lavender, etc) so we didn’t compromise the structure. You also get to add whatever high quality coffee you’d like!\n",

I do this because the resulting pasta water is really starchy, and this starchy pasta water works great for thickening sauces and emulsifying oil-based sauces.\n\nBoiling your pasta in much less water also means the water comes to a boil much faster because there's less of it to boil.\n\nFor some of my pasta dishes, I cook the pasta \"risotto style\" (pasta risottata, a legitimate pasta cooking method), where all the pasta water gets absorbed or boiled off. The resulting concentration of starch is particularly useful for emulsifying in oils. I do spaghetti aglio e olio this way, and it turns out great.\n",

It will make things go SO much easier. Be patient with your cooking. If you get in a hurry, things can go south really fast. Low and slow is usually better, depending on the recipe. And be realistic about how much time things take. Good example is bacon. I never fry it. I bake it in the oven on a cookie sheet with foil. Takes longer, but comes out evenly cooked and most importantly I don’t have to stand over it pretty constantly.\n",

				"Comment": "Okay, this is coming from a professional chef who specializes in baking, so listen up! If you cook anything cake-like and the ridge of the pan is higher than what the thing rose to, then you can add a layer of icing immediately after it comes out of the oven. Yes, it'll melt, but then the texture will change to a midway point between ganache and normal icing after it's cooled back down again! Also, the seal it creates is so strong, that it preserves the moisture of the thing underneath. Perfect for making brownies that aren't hard as rocks, like most people's! Especially because, after they've cooled, if you cut the brownies up, wrap them individually in plastic wrap, and then freeze them, then they'll have retained enough moisture and crumblyness to end up with a taste and texture that's nearly indistinguishable from an ice cream sandwich! Try it if you don't believe me!\n",

				"Comment": "If you’re baking and want something to be really tender but stable (like a cake), try reverse creaming. Instead of creaming your butter and sugar and then adding in ingredients, add your softened butter (or shortening or what have you), to your flour mixture first. Essentially, it limits the development of the gluten which is what can make baked goods tough. It’s a good way to closely mimic store-bought mixes while still being home made. \n\nIf making bread from scratch, ALWAYS knead the dough. It’s super easy to over-knead with mixers. You can sense when your dough is actually ready by hand instead of guessing. Makes a world of difference. \n\nAnother baking tip — have a spray bottle of just water on hand to squirt into your oven before putting in your baked goods. The added moisture almost always improves the texture. \n\nIf you’re cooking a Latin American dish — add Mexican oregano. It’s different from your usual oregano and it the flavor profile is earthy, warm, and slightly spicy. \n\nIf you want to eat sauerkraut and you’re an American: rinse your kraut first. Our kraut in America is waayyyyy over vinegarated compared to the real German stuff. \n\nI have plenty more too: an a trained professional baker and I love to cook. So if you have questions for your baked goods, please feel free to ask!\n",

				"Comment": "> It has harmed the economies of places that used to eat it and now sell it instead.\n\nI'd read that people who grow quinoa are eating a lot less quinoa because they're selling it instead.  The growers, as they have income now, can actually afford to eat things other than just quinoa.\n\nThat said, the expansion of quinoa agriculture is causing issues as sustainable practices aren't well developed.  When quinoa was a subsistence crop no one cared about the sustainability practices of the farmers growing it for local consumption; now that there's global demand there's growing global interest as well.\n",

He has been having fits at the price of wings here because they used to be a pretty common lunch for him (he works from home and I would toss some into the air fryer for him, at least it was healthier than what he used to get at the work cafeteria lol) and now they are a rare rare treat.\n\nHe is pretty stoked about this time of year though. I currently have 7 large turkeys thawing to be processed thru for the freezer and to can (at $0.69lb I hit the sale big and we'll eat it until Sept) and he will get mega wings, one or two at a time as a treat for his lunches. But normal wings? Rare. Thank everything I learned how to properly brine and cook the breasts, they, barring whole chickens, are the cheapest chicken to buy anymore.\n",

It was amazing and the experience is a good way to make friends AND work your mental and physical processes not to mention simulated combat gives you the opportunity to hone problem solving skills. It was a gentleman's game wherein you get hit, you announce you got hit.\n\nNow when it became popular, everyone is cheating and asking fights, being dicks to each other. They don't call the hits and they even use it as an excuse to do \"gang shit\". Next became the oogle fest for ladies who are in there not to participate but only to look good for some of the players or whatever. Some of the girls ignored them but they became uncomfortable because the other guys were talking shit about how \"this ain't a girl activity\" and that they should just \"cosplay like this pretty girl here\" and some shit.\n\nIt deterred a lot of actually good people. It just broke the experience making it really sad to join in and not participate. Last time I joined was years ago, almost a decade I think. It was the saddest match because my sniping is on point but no one is calling. I threw a grenade and then breached with some 3 guys doing semis but they just looked back at us and started shooting back. They did not call the shots yet we did ours.\n\nI sold my gear a few months after that.\n",

				"Comment": "So YMMV but I’ve noticed at the grocery store - while everything has definitely gone up - a lot of stuff is constantly on sale. So it was 8$ a couple of years ago, went up to 11$ but is very frequently on sale for 9$ now. And a lot of the produce is almost the same price it was +- a 1$. My total grocery bill went up about 40$ a week but now it’s often back down close to what it was a couple of years ago. \n\nThat said you have to have the ability to pay up front and store the stuff when it’s on sale. I have a house and a chest freezer. A lot of people don’t have the room or can’t buy 10 bags of something when it’s on sale and put it in the freezer.\n",

Panel and inverter adders had lower adders a lot of the time, same with cost baselines for full-service installers. The solar lenders interest rates started at 0.59%, dealer fees peaked at ~21.75% iirc. \n\nLots of the panel and inverter adders have gotten a bit cheaper now, but redlines have gone up by $1+/watt in most states which more than makes up for the lower equipment adders. And don’t even get me started on the lenders. Now the absolute lowest APR with most lenders that customers can get is 3.99% if they’re lucky but usually a 4.59% is the lowest they can go. The dealer fees that come with those rates is around 37-38% though. \n\nMy 2 cents: finance solar as a cash deal using a HELOC, your credit union, or do the highest APR with the lowest dealer fees (usually same as cash cost) and pay that bad boy off quicker than the loan term\n",

When I was in middle school ~25 years ago, there was an awareness campaign called \"Every 15 Minutes\", because there was a fatal road accident involving a teenager in the US every fifteen minutes on average, every single day. And that was just teenagers.\n\nIf you look at the numbers today, they're vastly better. The total deaths across all age groups is one per 12 minutes, which is a hell of a lot better than one per 15 minutes for just 13-19 year olds. \n\nLooked at from another statistic, the number of fatalities per 100 million miles driven, the difference is much more stark. Last year it was 1.35 fatalities per 100 million miles. In 1998, when I attended that awareness campaign event, it was 3.6 fatalities per 100 million miles driven. \n\nWe're almost 3 times less likely to die from vehicle crashes today, despite there being many more vehicle miles driven per year (3.26 trillion last year vs. 2.57 trillion in 1998).\n",

There was an omnipresent humming from all of the central air conditioning units though.  Also, if you walked through there instead of driving, you'd get suspicious looks.  I'm very white looking.\n\nIn the black neighborhood just a couple blocks away, you'd see people outside sitting around their stoops or hanging out on the sidewalk just chilling.  The weird thing is that people would say hello to me even though I was the only white guy there and I didn't feel unsafe nor unwelcome unlike my immediate neighborhood.

Older Scandinavian people tend to talk a lot about not wanting to be a burden to their family,  and they're usually pretty sincere about it. There is no cultural expectation that your kids and grandkids should take care of you when you're old. I like to think of it as a \"pay it forward\" rather than \"pay it back\" approach. Prioritize your kids, not your parents, is how older people often see things. And I think we're generally happy to spend money on the welfare state because we do want everyone to be taken care of. We just don't want to do it ourselves!\n\nScandinavian culture is also really focused on personal independence, so we'd rather leave the state in charge of caring for people than do it ourselves. We all have more personal freedom this way. For the most part this system works, but I completely understand why foreigners sometimes find us cold.\n",

				"Comment": "My theory is that if you gave people in developing countries resources and wealth like developed ones, that hospitality would disappear.\n\nWhen there is a major natural disaster in any American state, you see a community come together. Tornadoes that devastate a city will bring people that normally don't hang out or even like each other work together to survive. There are plenty of news stories out there that show heart warming images of people handing out food or providing a blanket to someone that needs it.\n\nWhat you don't see is the lack of that community once things are back to normal.\n\nWhen you need people and resources just to survive, you naturally form community. It's human nature. When you have everything you need, your community is only the people immediately around you (friends/family).\n\nI experienced this myself after the George Floyd protests. I went to help in some cleanup the day after one of the big looting nights in South Minneapolis. As I walked down one of the main streets, there were businesses handing out free food, people playing music, the local Target temporarily being converted to a food shelf, and so many people out cleaning that I actually didn't really get to do much work at all. George Floyd Square was full of people visiting for most that summer, despite covid.\n\nNow? People constantly complain online that George Floyd Square needs to get shut down (it's still been operating on a volunteer basis since 2020 and I drive through it all the time). Businesses on that main street have closed, some places have been vacant since the protests, and there isn't that sense of community anymore. It's back to being your typical segregated Minneapolis area.\n\nAnd what I have done since the protests? Nothing. I'm part of the problem. I still follow GFS on social media and keep telling myself I'm going to donate some clothes to their \"people's closet\", but have I done that since 2020? No. Have I donated any more money to the rebuilding effort that is still ongoing? No. Have I even visited GFS since 2020 (not counting driving past it)? No. Have I engaged with anyone I normally wouldn't in that community since the protests? Nope. My partner and a friend of mine lives in South, and those are the only people I hang out with. People are still in need in that area, and I've done nothing now that I feel safe again.\n",

It might also be skewed by the fact that people from rich countries can go to a poor country and think the middle-class family that invited them to dinner is poor, and poor people are actually making a sacrifice by sharing the little they have. Most poor countries are filled with corruption and many communities are often hostile because life there is a rat race. Many places that are unsafe for locals might be ok for tourists because local criminals don't want to risk killing tourist industry.  \n\nSure, you go to a poor village in my country (which isn't that poor) and you might end up getting invited to family dinners, and everyone will be warm and friendly. Next time you visit they will offer you free lodging and food, etc. The people will look like a nice community where neighbors help each other. But the mayor is corrupt and steals all the funding, and if you aren't friends with the right people they will turn on you and treat you like shit. If you try to build a house someone will constantly steal the materials overnight. If you moved there permanently you'd get to see the real situation, which wouldn't be nice.\n",

He died in 2015 with a MBA. After moving to the US as a teen, he always sent his aging mother money to take care of her, but in my childhood, he ended up moving his immediate family across the US to get away from ALL of the others because he was tired of \"the societal pressure\" to take care of everyone but his own immediate family.\n\nMy maternal grandfather died last month and I flew back across the country for his death and funeral.  My mom was one of eight.  Same thing. It was beautiful seeing them all, but I can 💯 understand why we moved 2500 miles across the country to get away from their expectations. One of my cousins who I hadn't spoken to in over a decade since we were children called me out of the blue a couple years back, and after 10-15 minutes of catching up, hit me up for money... Even though I told him that I had just had my first child who was born 16 weeks early, had spent 3 months in the NICU, and we were obviously dealing with mountains of child related expenses. They just see family as a comunial resource.\n",

Part of my focus is on how cultural and economic situations affect the diet of people. \n\nYou are actually completely wrong. 100% reverse of reality. Poor countries typically have a much worse diet and eat far less healthy foods because cheap calories are typically in the form of low quality carbohydrates. Particularly wheat and rice. Rice is in particular very unhealthy. Some studies even show it's worse per calorie for you than pure refined table sugar. Some countries with a large population and relatively little wealth such as India eat some of the worst food of any modern human. A common meal is fried flour with sugar and white rice. \n\nThe wealthy or the country the more nutritious the diet is. The effects of this diet are more my field of study, but the overall nutrition of somebody's diet decreases as your economic status decreases.\n\nEven the way food is prepped is much worse in poor countries. Frying food is actually more common in poor countries than rich ones. That is because oil is relatively cheap per calorie and a convenient way to cook food.\n",

When they are wrong it triggers that trauma, making them feel like they need to protect themselves, and they use the only defense mechanism they know.\n",

They’re the ones that never want to leave, ask if they can stay for dinner, sleep over etc and the parents never once check up on them or seem to care if they’re okay. I had one girl and her two baby sisters for an entire day, I asked her a few hours in where her parents were, weren’t they worried? When the baby needed their diaper changed, I sort of freaked out in my head but she changed her sister by herself. I knew then that SHE was the mother, and the actual mother was a sorry excuse for one. I ended up letting them stay for about a week, she got the chance to be a kid and I reinforced the idea that I didn’t want any more babies lol. I couldn’t imagine screaming at my child that they’re a burden. I have twins, and let me tell you, there were some TRYING A$$ moments lol, but they were never a burden. We choose to have them.\n",

Some people are straight up unwilling to comply with this request... they just keep on touching the people around them in this overly familiar way. People who can't regulate their hugging usually can't regulate all kinds of shit.

				"Comment": "Yup. Assuming you’ve won an amount with 10, 9, or even 8 figures, you go straight to your nearest major metropolitan city, straight to the biggest law firm in said city, and ask to speak to their top attorney who deal with trusts and estates. Make sure you record the conversation. And ask to have another attorney, preferably an equity partner, present in the room. \n\nAnywhere you go, the ticket stays in a pouch around your neck. Very important that you don’t sign the ticket, but do take several photos and a video of you with the ticket and email them to yourself before you leave. \n\nAfter that, the trust you’ve set up, not you, cashes in the ticket. You get to remain totally anonymous. Once you have everything else in place (hiring one of the big 4 accounting firms, drawing up a new will), only then do you decide who in your life to tell, if anyone.\n\nBad things happen to people who win big jackpots. Best case scenario for most is going bankrupt. Your chance of being murdered or overdosing go up way higher than normal. Do everything you can to minimize those outcomes before you actually get the money.\n",

The lottery company will do everything in their power to find a reason why you are not eligible to get the winnings, and you will get interrogated like youre a suspect to a crime. You wont see that money for weeks or even months if you dont have the proper proof. And for the love of god, when you sign the ticket, make sure its your actual signature and not a scratch/line like i see all the time. Otherwise it will take even longer.\n",

These laptops are for day use or for travel purposes but this guy always got away with keeping the laptop for a long time. We did yearly inventory so he had to bring it in once a year for us to eyeball or he would get charged for it. When he finally brings it in, it had missing keys and the power cable was frayed. It was scuffed up and had cookie crumbs in the keyboard. \n\nThe facility manager told the guy, \"You need to stop having your kids use the check out laptop.\" The professor swore up and down he didn't let his early elementary kids use it. I pop open the disc drive and find a DVD of a popular kids movie. They guy said nothing for a bit and promised to do better keeping the kids away from the laptop. (He didn't)\n\nWe still weren't able to ban the guy from checking out laptops. (I think he traveled a lot) We just made sure he got the same one each time to limit the physical abuse to one machine.\n\n(This was over fifteen years ago, so tablets weren't a thing and laptops were still a large ticket item)\n",

So the sales guy is showing it to a client and he's pretty impressed, and the dipshit owner walks up and decides to get involved.  He was notorious for his ego and getting in the way.  \n\nThe client says, \"I bet that thing can shred just about anything,\" and while yes it can, we only threw hard drives in it to not mess it up.  The owner goes, \"oh yeah it's great on laptops and sees a laptop sitting by the conveyer belt and just chucks the fucking thing in.  The teeth instantly catch it and it's gone in like 5 seconds.  \n\nIt was the clients work laptop, the diphsit owner just assumed it was one the hundreds or recycled laptops we have in the warehouse.  The client was fucking livid, yelling at the owner and asking why he would just grab anyones laptop and proceed to throw it in.  The owners ego kicks in and he says something dumb like \"We don't allow other peoples property in the warehouse and everything else in the warehouse I OWN.\" \n\nBut the best part was the client called back later that day and said his IT department didn't believe him, so we had to dig out what we could that resembled a laptop and throw it in a box and send it back to him.  The other best part is the custom shredder is in a trailer with it's own CCTV system, so we had it all on tape.  The warehouse manager would play that shit all the time to make us laugh.\n",

Lady brought in her laptop covered in pee because she got drunk at a party and thought it would be funny to do. Problem 1. we could smell it, problem 2 half of our guys were at the party. Warranty coverage denied, and she had to buy a new laptop to continue classes. They were $1500 each at the time.\n\nAlso had a guy with severe dandruff that would come in. It would get in through the keyboard, clog up the motherboard/fans, and it would overheat. They helped him 4 times before telling him if he comes in again with dandruff damage they are cancelling his warranty outright.\n",

The album has a suite style arrangement for side 1 where every song runs directly into the next.  Side 2 is long form soul jams which conclude with a reprise of the opening track to tie the whole album together.  Every track is about something that was plaguing society, especially the black community.  As far as I’m aware, it’s the first and only time a soul musician attempted something like this, and it’s brilliant.\n",

If anything I could imagine demand may go up when times are tough, because people will fix old “broken” cars rather than buy new ones. People might scrimp and save and stuff, or go without their car for a few weeks while they save up, or even get a car repossessed or sell one they can’t fix, but sooner or later the car is gonna get fixed up and back on the road, and a recession won’t make it more likely to get scrapped.

Taxi dropped me off with my luggage on the side of the road at midnight, refused to go any further. Hotel is two miles up the road. I'm in front of some random farm. Me walking woke their six pit bulls up and they start chasing me.\n\nFamily comes out. Mom, dad, two uncles, six kids. They ask what the fuck I'm doing out there. I speak limited Spanish, they speak no English. They call their sister in law, who's in New York.\n\nTurns out the area I'm in is one of the most dangerous stretches of road for miles. So bad they refuse to give me a ride to the hotel at night, and refuse to let me walk it. These angels let me head closer to their house so I can bum off their wifi since I have zero signal, and wait for my hotel to answer.  In the meantime, they have the uncles stand by the road with machetes, just so we don't get robbed while we talk. Hotel doesn't answer.\n\nSo, I'm offered a bed and a meal. By these complete strangers, mind you. I'm a bit flustered, but say yes. Whole time aunty on the phone is offering me assurances, these are good people. Here's my info, contact your family in the states to confirm who I am. It'll be okay, we won't let you get hurt.\n\nHotel finally responds just as they're helping me move my bags inside. Expected pickup in thrity minutes. Change of plans, stand with the gringa with machetes (the two uncles) and a shotgun (dad) while we wait. Dogs let me pet them. Kids are starting a soccer match.\n\nForty five minutes later, seal team six shows up. Six big, buff, burly men with shotguns and machetes pull up, plates match what the hotel gave me. Family won't let me go without double checking everything. Turns out it really was a bad area. I owe those people my life.\n",

I looked outside and saw these two massive dogs attacking a little dog who was being walked by its owner.\nI ran into my garage and grabbed a big ass broom and just started wailing on the pitbull who had the poor little dog in its mouth. The pit dropped the dog and both it and the rottweiler started paying attention to me. I just shouted as loud as I could and kept pushing the broom towards them, the rottweiler took off and the pit watched and left as well...\nThe woman walking the little dog scooped it up and ran away...there was blood everywhere on the street and pavement. \nI called the police and they took a statement. I was full of adrenaline, didn't realize the gravity of it until afterwards.\nTurns out the offending dogs got out of a yard across the street, the owner got fined and put up a new fence eventually.\nA few days later a case of beer shows up on my porch, it was from the attacked dogs owner. She had contacted the police to see who helped her dog. The dog survived after surgery. I still think about them.\n",

I managed to make it across the street and get the kid strapped into his stroller and while I was checking on the grandfather, the next person showed up to help. Fortunately, since we were a block away from a hospital, he was a nurse and much more qualified than I was to help the grandfather who had cracked his head on the sidewalk.\n",

				"Comment": "I used to work in construction rebuilding fire damaged homes and apartments.  When you do this, all of the appliances are replaced regardless of whether or not they work.  My boss would always just throw the old ones away until I decided to start selling them after I  fix them up as a little side hustle.\n\nWell, my elderly neighbor had recently had her husband pass away, and had fallen down  and broken her hip.  She was in a rehab facility and they weren't going to let her come home because of the conditions of her house.  So, I volunteered to clean it all for her.  I couldn't believe it when I saw it.  \n\nThere was about two inches of mouse shit everywhere but the walking paths through the house.  No furnace, no working stove, nothing...  I guess she had a lot of sight loss and needed Lasik but couldn't get an appointment to get the needed referral for medi-cal to pay for it.  I cleaned that place spotless and luckily, was able to give her a working stove, washer, and furnace I had taken home from my construction job.  I even repiped the entire place because the pvc pipes were in such bad condition.  Then when she got out, I called my bishop who is an optometrist and he came that day after work and wrote her the referral to get Lasik.  I remember after she got the Lasik I went over to check on her and she was making dinner and she said something akin to it being the first time in a decade that she could actually see the food she was cooking and use the stove at all.  I was so happy to have helped.  She passed away a few years ago, but she did so living in her home watching the televangelists she loved so much.  Miss you, Nikki!\n",

I did nothing at first, hoping he’d clear it, but he stood up and started turning blue. I stood up, got behind him, was just able to grasp my hands together around his trunk and started trying to administer the Heimlich maneuver. The second try dislodged whatever he was choking on. It looked like meat and rice. His wife stood up crying, and started calling me her Christmas miracle. \n\nWe were at a restaurant a half block from Lona Linda Hospital, and there were at least half a dozen medical staff in scrubs also eating. No one else did anything to help. I’m guessing they were afraid of the potential liability issues.\n",

I was pretty drunk as well until adrenalin kicked in when I realised I should do whatever I can for this girl. She fell of her bike and was crying real bad. Checked for injuries, nothing too serious besides a bloody nose. We gently turned her on her side just in case she would throw up and might choke on it. Her friends did not want to call her mother because she could get in trouble for being drunk. I convinced her friend to call anyway or I would call emergency services. Just wanted to make sure she was going to be safe. And I comforted her and said everything is gonna be ok. Took off my coat and tried to keep her warm and as comfortable as possible til her mom came by to pick her up. This was in the middle of a cold december night. I felt real bad for her and I was glad I could make a difference. There were many times I helped out complete strangers but this was one of the most fulfilling for me.\n",

While there, there was a family of both mom and dad and four kids that were out of gas and somewhat stranded with no food to feed the kids.  During that stop I didn’t do anything to help them but went on back to work.  From my desk at work I could see the family sitting there, not many people were stopping to help.  Things got the better of me and so I called my wife and told her the situation.  She met me at work and we went over to where they were and talked to them a bit to see what was up and what we could do to help.  They told us the dad had lost his job and they were moving to California where they had family, they literally had nothing.  There was a Comfort Inn right next door so we rented them a room for the night, we took them to Walmart to buy necessities and food to feed them all for several days.  We filled up their van with gas and gave them enough gas money to reach California.  About a week later we got a letter in the mail from them, post marked California saying they had arrived and they were very thankful for our help.  Sure they could have taken advantage of us, but that wasn’t the case this time.\n",

Then I saw the most joyously oblivious husky come running after it. He just runs right across all 4 lanes of traffic and he's lucky to have survived that much but he lost sight of the deer and you could tell he was just going to keep running in and out of traffic until he found it or got run over so I called him over and kind of negotiated getting close to him until I could get a hand on his collar. I walked him back the direction he came from until I found a young lady who was missing a dog and I headed home. \n\nThe whole thing took like 10 minutes and wasn't terribly difficult but if nobody stopped for him there's a decent chance he would have died. It would have been a huge deal if somebody had done it for me and my dog so I'm pretty proud of it.\n",

But while those shows are both still culturally relevant and streaming hits, nobody cares about this show at all now. Tim Allen is more remembered for Santa Clause and Toy Story.\n\nDynasty - People remember Dallas, but Dynasty actually surpassed it popularity for a bit, and it was the #1 show in TV at one point.\n\nWithout a Trace - After CSI popularized the crime scene investigation procedural, there was a massive influx. Some also became binge shows people remember like NCIS, but Without a Trace was a top 10 hit for multiple seasons and nobody seems to remember it even in comparison to shows it was a bigger hit than like Bones.\n\nThen there’s just all the other random 90’s sitcoms that were actually massive top 10 hits but didn’t have the impact of Friends, Seinfeld, Will & Grace, and so on. Veronica’s Closet, Suddenly Susan, Major Dad, Grace Under Fire, Coach, and so on.\n",

Plus something about killing his beloved brother and nephew because girl power. It was just emblematic of things to come.\n\nThere were problems in earlier seasons but the problem was D&D took the wrong message and themes (not just for book reports) from the books. Yea the world is dark and people do terrible things. But the people who are righteous, even if they don’t succeed, are ultimately vindicated. Book Ned was merciful not because he was dumb but because he refused to endanger children. That’s why the North rallied to rescue “Arya” from the Boltons while a man like Tywin has his legacy fall apart the moment he dies.\n\nBut the show wound up with this “might makes right” theme. And also with the idea that any woman must be a cold jerk because that’s strength and compassion (as book Sansa or Sam or Davos) shows is weakness.\n",

But I see the way those ended as likely very close to what GRRM told them. Dany's actions in King's Landing were predicted in early seasons in a vision. Jaime going back to the worst woman in the world sounds exactly like the kind of tragedy that gets GRRMs jimmies rustling.\n\nThe problem is they couldn't seem to tell these stories properly. The audience failed to buy it.\n\nAs for the whole Night King thing. I feel like there's a whole lot left out that made people think it was dumb. It's made clear in an earlier season that a Weir Tree can block the power to resurrect the dead. Bran under the tree is the bait that forces the Night King to approach to deal with him. Arya is the trap. A hidden blade sent overseas years ago and trained as an assassin. It's implied that a god or some greater force has been moving them all into this position. Perhaps the role of many of these pieces was to be sacrificed (such as the Dothraki and Theon) to help draw in the Night King to the trap.\n\nYou could totally make all of this make sense, and it seems like the threads are there to do so... but they just didn't.\n",

He always complains about his knives being crappy, and it's about the one thing left i can buy him that he hasnt already bought for himself lol. \n\nHopefully i knocked it out of the park given the budget i had.\n",

He’s been getting into prepping and wilderness survival and this place not only has basic classes for beginners, which I think he might be past, but super cool specific ones like stone tool making and bow and arrow making and more. I’m so excited for him to see the options! I hope he likes it!\n",

I have seven siblings and we do not buy for all seven siblings anymore so I have one present for my youngest sister, a pair of headphones.\n",

				"Comment": "Two months ago today, my youngest daughter, who is 20 years old, had a terrible accident. She was going to have a shower, put the water as hot as she could to get started quickly, stepped into the bathtub, and had an epileptic fit that lasted for 45 minutes. The bathtub was filled with extremely hot water, and she was almost boiled alive.\nShe came out of it with third degree burns on 53% of her body, and we were first told that they did not know if they could save her life, and if they did, it was unsure whether she would get to keep her hands and her feet. She was kept in a medically induced coma for a while, and then they transplanted all available unharmed skin on to the parts which were burned. I could not hold her hands, I could not give her a proper hug. I could only hold my cheek carefully against her left cheek, which was the only part which was neither burnt nor skinned.\nBut on Christmas Eve, they had saved her life, and they had saved her hands and her feet. She was allowed to come out of the hospital for a few hours in a wheelchair, to have Christmas dinner with us.\nWhen she arrived she opened out her arms and gave me a big hug. The first real hug since the accident.\nAnd that hug was the best Christmas present ever.\n",

I got a seasonal positional at lush to help with pay for Christmas gifts, and Lush employees get 50% off all items. This year I got my mom, sister, and my grandma the luxury gifts at Lush. I really hope they like their gifts this year, and I can bring them a little happiness. We all had a hard year.\n",

				"Comment": "I’ll admit, I was mad.\n\nAnd it was totally petty. I’m the new member of the group, after all, the low man on the totem pole. And SOMEBODY had to take trauma call Christmas Eve. AND take back-up trauma call Christmas Day.\n\nI was rounding in the ICU postcall Christmas morning. I was tired, having been up all night. But I was nowhere near exhausted as the families gathered by each bedside to hold their holiday vigil. By the time I finished updating them all, putting in orders, reviewing labs and CT scans, writing notes, and fiddling with knobs and gauges, it was 4 pm. After the 20 minute drive home there was just time enough to fling a hoverboard each with ribbon and bow at my niece and nephew before the phone rang. It was my partner on-call at the hospital.\n",

I honestly don't even fucking know. Probably some cologne.\n\nWell, divorced parents, so two christmasses, and I drew my Dad's name there. So that's easy. Some puzzle or home craft stuff. He likes to zone out and relax by doing that kind of stuff.\n",

We saw them in May together and he enjoyed it but wasn’t really super familiar with the band’s music, now he is obsessed. We’re telling him by using the calendar i got him - I wrote on the date of the concert to say he’s going.\n",

Our parents buy household items in BULK like everything from toilet paper and paper towels to carpet fresh and washing detergent. And they wrap them all! We have as much fun unwrapping our household essentials as the kids do with their toys!! Needless to say, I love and appreciate them so much for doing that❤️\n",

It sucks to tell people you love that they hurt you, but it lead to a long conversation, several apologies, and a long hug.\n\nWhat about you, what are you keeping hidden away?\n",

				"Comment": "The secret that I keep hidden in my heart, is the tragedy of my brother. My brother was prone to getting hives and blisters break out during fits of anxiety. \n\nAs a 12 year old I tried to do what I thought was best one time. I tried to rub vinegar and oil all over his skin to make them go away, but that just irritated his skin even more. He got into his angry mood where he screens “whooop” every 5 seconds. \n\nI thought I could calm him down by throwing him in the pool. I thought he was just joking when he was flailing about in the pool. I forgot he couldn’t swim. My mom came outside to hear what was going on and became furious with me. Needless to say I got in a lot of trouble.\n",
