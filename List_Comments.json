				"Comment": "The myth dates back to the 1930s, when the French entomologist August Magnan noted that a bee's flight should be impossible, because of the haphazard way their wings flapped around. And if bees flew like aeroplanes, he would be correct.\n\n…..\n\nAnother study from 2005, by biology professor Michael Dickinson from the University of Washington, also concluded that bees flap their wings back and forth, not up and down. This was previously a big misconception about the way insects fly, and could have originally been what tripped Magnan up in the first place.\n\nAn aeroplane's wing forces air down, which pushes the plane upwards. Insects sweep their wings in a partial spin. Rather than being like a propeller, the angle to the wing creates vortices in the air like small hurricanes. The eyes of these mini-hurricanes have a lower pressure than the air outside, which lifts the bees upwards.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/bees-cant-fly-scientifically-incorrect-2017-12?amp\n",

Bee wings make short, quick sweeping motions front and back, front and back. This motion creates enough lift to make it possible for bees to fly.\"\n\n\"Scientists think that the style of flying bees use let them carry heavy loads when needed. That ability comes in handy a lot for honey bees, who carry nectar and pollen from flowers back to the nest.\"\n",

Women used to die frequently in child birth, you can't take out out 50% of the population for good representation. Saying well people lived fine lives so long as they are older then 13 and not a woman is kinda pointless. When you do look at that group the evidence is that the life expectancy was better than 30 but still not great.\n\nExample of average ages by looking at the lives of Royalty\"Eliminating individuals who died before adulthood completely, from the dates recorded below, the mean life expectancy for women was 43.6 years, with a median of 42/43; for men, it was a mean of 48.7 and a median of 48/49.\"\n\nWikipedia has some info as well, most of it is life expectancy at birth but it does have some useful info in the tables including for late medieval english peerage\n\n\"In Europe, around one-third of infants died in their first year.[17] Once children reached the age of 10, their life expectancy was 32.2 years, and for those who survived to 25, the remaining life expectancy was 23.3 years. Such estimates reflected the life expectancy of adult males from the higher ranks of English society in the Middle Ages, and were similar to that computed for monks of the Christ Church in Canterbury during the 15th century.[30] At age 21, life expectancy of an aristocrat was an additional 43 years (total age 64).[38]\"\n\nEssentially shit was still fucked.\n",

Could you imagine a python sliding up next to an antelope and calmly trying to compare measurements? Besides, the most common pet snakes are too small to eat a full grown human anyway.

This is also why pregnant women are encouraged to do them, so that after childbirth the vagina returns to pre-childbirth conditions. Which is hilarious! What kegels really help with is muscle control so you don't pee yourself when you cough or sneeze.

It was one of those black plastic film containers.\n\nHesitant, but curious, we removed the lid.\n\nIt contained a collection of one-cent pieces which had been minted in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nPart of me is disappointed, part of me is relieved.\n",

He'd given away all his valuables, family pictures were sorted by year stacked neatly on a table, he'd gone to the bank and cleared out his accounts and safety deposit box out (assuming he gave the money away), he signed his paid off car registration over to my aunt (the youngest sibling) and left a note to give her the keys, and all his good clothes (suits, dress shoes, dress shirts) were packed up for donation so that someone down on their luck might be able to wear them to an interview. It was clean and organized, which wasn't really his style. His place was always cluttered and lived a messy lifestyle. He was the life of the party, he was always popular and well-liked and fun, and he must have been so sad. He was only 54.\n",

He secretly gave me this money recently and just told me to “hold onto it”. It’s not an insignificant sum. \n\nHe likes to travel (as do I) and we often discuss what country is next etc. I’ve noticed (my wife and her sisters don’t seem to have picked up on this) that he’s hammering through his travel bucket list at the moment. They might not even know he has this travel list but it’s starting to worry me a bit. Like he knows he’s on a clock and on a mission to tick his boxes. He’s all over the place and just going on these solo missions. One place in particular we both agreed we’d go to together he just casually popped up in the middle of the fucking desert a few months back and that was that, he’d been and went by himself. Just apologised that he found himself in that neck of the woods etc (as you do)! \n\nTo me he’s clearly just tying up loose ends.\n",

Broke my heart.\n\nEdit - wow! Sorry to depress so many people on a Friday night 😅 My Dad/his best friend actually found the diary and saved it from the house before all the other family pounced. My dad didn’t care about material possessions but he wanted to protect my uncles thoughts. It did feel wrong to be reading it but curiosity killed the cat.\n\nSome of these commenters seem like they need a pep talk. To all those saying that they are going to end up like my uncle, if you don’t want to, you don’t have to. Your life isn’t over until it’s over but it’s up to you and only you to get what you want out of life. Step out of your comfort zone, maybe less time on Reddit 😅do something new, volunteer, join a club, maybe move to a new place, get a new job…you never know who you will meet. \n\nMy brother sat in his room for years drinking beer and playing computer games but one day he decided to give rock climbing a go. He now manages a climbing wall place, is mega fit and he met a lovely woman who loves also climbing and he spends his weekends on cliff edges around the UK. I finally found my partner online dating after moving from London to Liverpool. Yes online dating sucks so much, especially in London but it can work! Kissed a hell of a lot of frogs. 😵‍💫\n\nGood luck!\n",

My father faced a lot of prejudice during his lifetime and I was terrified of telling him that the 'white guy' I'd been on a date or two with I was getting serious with.  The first time I brought my now husband home, my dad was courteous but distant. Miraculously, by the second time my father literally gushed all over my husband. Even my siblings were shocked. When we got married, he was beaming. It was odd, but I was just happy my husband had won him over. \n\nMy mom died in 2014 and my father in 2021. When my siblings and I went to clean out the house, in his safe along with other important documents, we found letters that my husband had written to my father 24 years before about how he felt about me, how he was serious about his relationship with me, how he was planning to go to law school (he did, he's an attorney now) how he respected that he'd gone through so much in his lifetime, and eventually how he loved me and how with his blessing, he was going to propose. My husband never told me he'd written my father and my father never told me he'd been corresponding with my husband. It was so emotional finding those. I still tear up when I think about it. When I got home, my husband finally showed me the letters my father had written back.\n",

They never had children. \n\nMy dad gently convinced the neighbor that banks were safe now, and explained the FDIC, and eventually convinced him to put it in a bank. The first bank they tried called the cops on my dad because he was clearly taking advantage of this kind elderly senior. Which..what? But, ok then.\n\nCops advised them to get an attorney, which ate into the neighbor's funds a bit, but they managed to get the money into a bank (savings and checking! And my dad taught him to balance his checkbook.)\n\nIt was a hassle at the time, but I think back on it as being very sweet. (My dad was totally appalled and hugely worried when they got all the cash out & counted it--and then when he had to patiently explain the federal reserve in detail multiple times--and the first bank did that, and they had to find a good laywer, all of which took at least a month). \n\nThey became pretty good friends--though my dad always called him \"Mr.. __________,\" rather than using his first name.\n",

He could have been responsible for hundreds of civilian casualties and we’ll never know.\n\nAfter the war he ended up staying in the UK became a citizen, married a farm girl and had 4 kids.

I cleaned out both their homes and found calls, texts, and love letters. They wanted to be together again but didn't want to put their kids and grandkids through a reconciliation until they were confident it'd work out. \n\nI knew she'd be devastated, they had been together almost thirty years, but they were two years divorced and casually seeing other people. They seemed to be thriving apart. So it was a shock when the grief was so strong that it took all the life out of her. She died of cancer, but the doctor also diagnosed her with Failure to Thrive brought on by the loss of my dad, and said that it may have been possible for her to live longer and even receive treatment if the Failure to Thrive hadn't taken everything she was before her cancer diagnosis. \n\nThe only thing worse than losing my dad was watching my mom live without him, so at the end of the day, I'm grateful she didn't live without him for long. She never would have had peace here again. She found her peace with him on the other side.\n",

He was adopted by his stepfather when he was 3.  My Dad only saw him a couple of times, he was married to his Mom but they divorced after a few months and She took Daniel and moved across the country.   He knows he has 1/2 sibs but doesn’t want to meet us or have a relationship.   The weirdest thing about it, he is a carbon copy of my dad.  \n\nBonus surprises, I never knew my Dad was married before my mom.  I also found out that my Mom was married before my Dad too.  No kids, apparently her 1st hubs used my mom as his beard.  He married her and 3 days later moved to Hollywood with his “best friend”to become a star.

On the back of the card, there were 21 lines written in pencil. Each year, my grandpa would write on the back of the card the date and the year of his new birthday. With a different small note beside it each year. Like, “miss you terribly this time”, or “you would have liked the weather today”.\n\nAll up to his last birthday. Broke my heart.

				"Comment": "\nMy grandaunt was incredibly rich. My grandfather was just one of four siblings, and he gave each of his grandchildren a five digits share just because he had no idea what to do with the money that suddenly popped up. All the years we knew her we had no reason to assume she had money - never worked, widowed early, and her partner (who was dead for 30+ years when she followed him) hadn't been rich neither. Unfortunatly we only discovered that among other things she owned two houses next to the one she was living in, but we never found out how she got that money. She had been walking around like a beggar, always used products already long past their use by date and her home wasn't modernized after the 60s. The money just popped up everywhere, in every drawer. And both homes generated rent income, but even this didn't explain the amount of money. There were hints for another house she owned, but apparently it was already sold at the time of her death. It all remained an unsolvable mystery to us.\nMy grandfather (the other one, not the one mentioned above) was in the Nazi Party. My father had denied this, but I found proof for it in the documents. He then admitted it, but told me he was forced to join. Given the documents I found and the time he joined etc I believe this was the truth\nThe worst tiny secret in my eyes, one of the few moments in my life I completely lost my shit, was after my mother's loss I found a small birthday gift she had already bought for me, a small angel with some lines hoping that I'm always protected. Words can't describe my anger and frustration with the world when I found this. After all I was clearing out the house after she had been brutally murdered.\n\n",

One was from a sister teasing him about how she bet he wished he was in school instead for once. Apparently, a neighbor had accused my grandfather of stealing a chicken, and he was taken away. My great grandfather had died, so my grandfather was the man of the house, and my great-grandmother didn't speak English. We don't know many details, other than that he was there for close to a year. My grandfather's older brother was injured in the war and sent back to the States to recover, and once he was able to walk again, he got my grandfather out. The neighbor who called the police on my grandfather was my grandmother's mother.\n",

We cared for as she aged, and she passed away in her 80s. When we went to clean out her home, my husband found a leather document folder with her marriage certificate. As he looked further, he found there were also divorce documents from three pervious husbands from across the country that we had never heard of. Apparently, she spent her teens and 20s working with a traveling carnival during the depression, and made the best of it.\n",

My mom only married the guy as a way to get back at her ex boyfriend that she was in love with. She's now on her technically 4th marriage and it's to a woman. I guess she gave up on men.\n",

We found extensive files he kept on everyone and pages and pages of his crabbed handwritten notes about how he was superior to everyone and how stupid and worthless my mother and her children are. It may sound like I’m making a fuss out of nothing, but his hatred emanates off the pages. \n\nHe told people that he actually wrote the books she wrote. Provably false. He deliberately kept them poor hoping that it would spur her to write a best seller and he could live off the wealth. He tried to kill her at least once that we know of. And the last time I ever spoke to that evil man was when somehow my mother’s oxygen got turned off and somehow she dialed my phone number in her sleep. I could hear the machine clicking and couldn’t get her to answer. I called the police in their city and state and got an ambulance out there. He subsequently called me and screamed at me for calling for an ambulance for my mother. \n\nHe was the meanest most evil person I ever met in my life. Thankfully his first wife raised their two children, who are superlative human beings and nothing like that miserable POS.\n",

				"Comment": "I've always heard it's an age thing that time seems like it's moving faster, but (obviously) it isn't actually but the way you remember it is what changes. When you're a kid, everything is new. Even places you go all the time you'll see something new, or realize something new. And of course you're learning things in school and on TV and you're brain is automatically filing all this shit away because for survival purposes a kid needs to be aware of everything around them and integrate all the information possible in order to survive. It's almost constantly learning or refining what its learned. \n\nIn general the older we get the more stable our lives become. We've seen the things - two birds interacting in a tree isn't something to study and v wonder at and file away like it is to a 4 year old. We do essentially the same thing every day, and even our free days tend to be mostly the same as the other. Your brain can rely on learned information and rarely needs to \"record\" new info.\n\nTime doesn't move any differently but when you look back in your memory everything blends together so it feels like less time has passed. Your brain has literally changed less and therefore has no reason not to just blend the days together. There are probably events that strongly stand out but they're bright spots in a quagmire of redundancy that your brain has no need to differentiate. So it feels like no time at all.\n\nBut if there IS a radical change in your life you'll get a taste of \"kid time\" again. The first few weeks of meeting someone you're falling deeply in love with might feel like months. If you move to a totally new place or have the opportunity to travel abroad each day might feel like 45 hours instead of 24. A week traveling through Asia will feel like a month.\n\nBasically how we experience the passage of time is about how much our brain has to engage and the number of things it needs to learn. And no matter what we do we'll never have to learn the WHOLE WORLD and ALL ABOUT PEOPLE and WTF IS SOCIETY ever again like kids do.\n",

Turns out, she was struggling hard with an eating disorder due to a breakup. She brought it up to me on her own one day when we were talking and was thankful I didn’t compliment her weight loss like other people had. \n\nI think it’s always safest to not comment on peoples weight.

Giving two kisses is not only customary but expected in a group of friends. Even if you’re meeting a new female acquaintance in your friend group, you do it. If people around you are doing it and you decide to abstain, you will often receive some awkward glances. \n\nIn a professional setting, I would never initiate “la bise” with anyone. Period. But I’ve been on the receiving end from female colleagues with whom I have a closer personal relationship. There’s nothing sexual about it and it usually only happens in more social or casual settings… and it’s very prevalent in any celebratory situation. For example, your team has finished a big event and decide to get some beers. You would always greet your female colleagues (and sometimes even male colleagues with whom you have a particularly close personal relationship) with the kisses. Same for when you are leaving. \n\nThat said, from my experiences working in Spain, I have seen this happen less frequently than in France. In Italy, it’s the other way around. Much more common in my experience.\n",

Corsets were designed to be comfortable. Women wore a cotton layer underneath the corset, so it didn't rub against the skin. The corset was more like a bra, bit instead of using the shoulders to support it used the whole torso. Some people claim they are much more comfortable than modern bras. The intense proportions of the past were achieved with Corsets AND padding. Tight lacing was uncommon, but layers of petticoats or hoops or bum rolls or whatever else at the time was very common to give women the trendy body shape at the time.\n",

Three are permanently dislocated. \n\nAs a result, modern bras are wildly uncomfortable -- the bottom of the band presses against the uppermost busted rib. I mostly wear bandeaus, which distribute the pressure more equally.\n\nI've been contemplating creating a new, custom corset for myself. Figuring out how to place the boning exactly right has been a challenge -- I need to redistribute pressure away from my ribs but also not have the boning bend in and put pressure on them inadvertently. \n\nOnce I get the boning patterns sorted, I'll be able to translate that to my reenactment stays. But I'll also be able to apply those to some modern undergarments -- I should be able to make girdle or similar to help protect my ribs and support my bust.\n",

If they were so awful, there’s no way that would’ve lasted long. \n\nAs you said, they wore a chemise (or shimmy) as their under-most undergarment. They never wore their stays/corsets against their bare skin. That’s extremely uncomfortable and also not good for the garment. \n\nPadding played a huge role in creating the desired silhouette and a lot of people don’t realize that. A lot of Victorian (esp late Victorian) and Edwardian photos were also edited to make a lady’s waist look smaller. If you look closely at some of them, you can make out the actual waistline.\n",

(Among a bunch of other things, she's an art history professor that specializes in \"material culture\" which is basically the study of the stuff people owned and what it meant for them). She interned at Mount Vernon and wrote about the teeth, which they actually still have there, and I asked her about this stuff. It wasn't uncommon to buy human teeth or hair for dentures and wigs at the time and a lot of poorer people would sell theirs. If I recall correctly there were a couple of different human teeth, some from slaves and some from free people. There are records and they actually bought the teeth in question from the slaves at the same rates they would have bought them from anybody else. The idea that anybody would be so poor that they were willing to sell teeth is pretty awful, and in the case of enslaved people the whole reason they were that poor to begin with was that their labor had been stolen from them and possibly their families' labor for generations, so it wasnt like it was a \"free market\" and totally fair transaction. But that said they weren't forcibly ripping teeth out of anybody's face totally against their will, the \"donors\" got paid a pretty significant amount for them. If I recall correctly some of the teeth in his dentures were also made of elephant and hippo ivory, he went through a few sets and the craftsmen that made them used different things depending on what technology was thought to be best at the time.\n",

				"Comment": "Pop history likes to claim that Columbus was a dumb idiot that simply thought the world was smaller than it was and got lucky hitting the West Indies.\n\nQuite honestly the issue wasn’t simply that people doubted the diameter of the globe but that there wasn’t a good way to measure the length of the continent of Eurasia. The Longitude Problem is a classic conundrum that boils down to: it’s easy to determine latitude (how far north-south you are) with the stars. But determining how east-west you are boils down to how much you trust your dead reckoning.\n\nOver the centuries European and Arabic scholars had charted pretty good estimates of the width of the Mediterranean. This is helped because it’s a busy mercantile corridor (lots of ships to get data from) that’s nearly straight east-west. You sail from Tyre to Carthage or Genoa to Barcelona and you know how long it takes and you can figure out distance.\n\nThat’s a lot harder on the open ocean when you have no landmarks and no reliable timekeeping.\n\nNow let’s look at Eurasia. To get there from the east end of the Mediterranean you are getting off your ship and going over land via Silk Road, or cutting through the Red Sea or Persian Gulf, and around India and the Straits of Malacca. Either way your reliable distance formulas are going to be murky.\n\nIn this circumstance it’s easy to see why someone might think Asia is much longer than we now know it to be. Long enough to span the Pacific Ocean such that the West Indies are confused with the East Indies.\n",

The science and philosophy of Aristotle was studied, revised, and interpreted based on observational work.

Castle is built inside of the cave in the middle of the vertical cliff. He did some shit that made Austrian emperor very angry, so Austrian army paid him a visit. Because the castle is in the middle of the cliff, however, they couldn't do shit about it, so they decided to lay siege and wait for Erazem's food supply to run out. But because the castle also sits on top of an extensive cave system that Austrians didn't know about, their siege wasn't very effective.\n\nTurns out that every man needs to take a shit from time to time, and the toilet of the Predjama castle is in a place that's very easy to hit with canon fire. The story everyone heard in school was that Austrians bribed one of his servants, who signalled the Austrians when Erazem went to the toilet in the evening. Austrians then proceeded to obliterate the toilet with cannon fire, killing Erazem.\n\nCool story, except for one bit. Erazem did eat a cannon ball, but not while on the toilet.\n",

Prior to the Highland Park Plant building Model Ts, assembly lines consistent of workers moving down a line of products waiting for assembly. The workers would bring the parts and the requisite tools with them as they moved down the line.\n\nFord's moving assembly line moved the product from one fixed worker station to the next. This was much, much more efficient a process: it meant that workers would only have to focus on assembling their part of the car as the line moved past them, with all their tools staying in place and a steady stream of new parts being fed into the assembly stations as required.

She was mostly hated for xenophobic reasons, because she was from Austria and the contemporary French street mob hated Austrians.\n\n\nTBH she was terrible with money, spending a lot of cash on luxuries.

War bows needed a huge amount of strength quite the opposite to the common modern perception of the weapon as ideal for slender less built people. You needed to be trained since teenage years to be proficient and strong enough to pull a war bow in most cases. Thus it should come as no surprise that people didn't \"hold their fire\" before letting their arrow loose like in movies. You notch the arrow, aim and release in less than 5 second. Also archers often prioritized shooting ate relatively shorter distance than max parabolic range, shooting straight to maximize stopping power. Ah and fire atrows, while they did exist, they were less anti personal weapons and more so aimed at ships or thatch roofs historically.\n",

She's been rid of him for over ten years I believe. She's the happiest I've ever seen her. She's with a guy who seems to be a good dude and her career is going well and her family life is great.

We also were a table of about 7 as well. \n\nThe dad asked the waitress to get more salsa for the table, and it looked like she had a lot of tables to wait as well. He waited like 3-5 minutes before he got up and straight up left. \n\nHe comes back with a store bought jar of salsa and slams it on the table and says “screw this place and their shitty service, had to get my own salsa and ha it tastes even better than their crap.” And he said this loudly too..\n\nFelt so bad for the waitress that I stayed behind and apologized.\n",

Like most things, it stems from experiences in childhood which taught you that life is easiest when you blend in and remain agreeable. Fight, flight, freeze, or in the case of the chameleon, fawn.   \n\nWe all do various versions of mirroring regardless of childhood experiences, and fawning like a chameleon is one of them. Also as another commenter said, its often caused by having an opportunity to tap into a different part of your personality. Different people or situations can bring out different traits.  \n\nIt’s something I always felt bad about until my psychiatrist bestie explained it to me. With my closest friends and family I am consistently my truest self, but around people I’m less familiar / comfortable with I often match their energy to make socializing more comfortable for them. I don’t change my morals or beliefs, but I do often talk like the other person or become either sweeter or sassier. All of this also depends on my mood, energy level, etc.  \n\nIt can definitely go too far and it’s a good thing to know about yourself. It can be hard to recognize because it’s typically a subconscious coping skill. There are pros and cons to doing it.\n",

Now, more and more, I've noticed a pattern with people who try too hard to appear a certain way are just over compensating. Like flashing money and designer bags when they're broke, posting incessantly about how happy they are when they're miserable, etc. \n\nI'm probably preaching to the choir here, but consciously recognizing this has changed my perception of quite a few people I know.\n",

And then suddenly she found religion and everything she talked about was about it. It was her whole thing. \"God says this...\", \"I'll pray for you\", \"I can't talk about (blank) anymore, it goes against God\", etc. It was like she wasn't even the same person anymore and I suddenly lost my friend.

Forty THOUSAND dollar Mercedes.”\n\nWhich is a lot of money but Hello that’s obviously not nearly even the nicest car here. I ended up feeling really sorry for her. She had this designer dress on, with a designer handbag, and designer keychain, and designer sunglasses. The next two times she came in she had the same outfit. \n\nIt was clear she had spent everything on these objects to project who she merely wanted to be but didn’t have the funds to pull off. \n\nJust an unhappy woman who was masquerading as somebody no one cares about anyway.\n",

Our job is not hard. If a person is out for a day no one actually notices a change in our overall operation. My boss closed our office down at 3:30 the day before Thanksgiving and my coworker stayed and worked the whole day because “what else is he going to do” I was like “you’re married and you were already complaining earlier in the day that your wife had a half day. Don’t you want to go home and spend time with your wife?” What gets me the most is we don’t get overtime, he’s not getting paid any different by staying late. My company is really small there’s only 10 employees. There’s no moving up in the company. It’s just your boring 9-5 tech job but he acts like he’s so cool bragging about how much he works and it’s just like dude I don’t find that cool I find it pathetic and really sad.

In 1905, the song “In My Merry Oldsmobile” became a major hit with its slightly suggestive lyrics. \n\nHell the Oldsmobile Rocket 88 was the inspiration for “Rocket 88”, one of the very first rock and roll songs - it is often credited for launching rock and roll as a genre.\n\nBack in 2004, it quietly disappeared with a whisper along with a handful of other car brands that year.\n",

His bodyguard came up to me and asked me if I knew who he was and I was caught off guard and said no. He then proceeded to be given a tour of the store by an employee. He asked for like a 4XL shirt but they didn’t have any that size but that sometimes he could order them online. This is one of my most surreal memory from my childhood. It’s not even that crazy of a story but people always question me because why would Fat Joe go to an ecko store at an outlet mall. I don’t why either but he did. Just wanted to share my ecko store memory that this comment brought back.\n",

With all the bonuses and whatnot, I had been following the NFL intently for fantasy and I was able to take advantage of all the freebies and boosts and make a little money but since then it's dried up. I took positive balances out and left a little behind to make small bets on basketball and baseball. NBA was really unpredictable for my knowledge level, baseball was good into June and got harder to bet on.\n\nIt's extremely predatory. The introductory boosts hit a lot and over time they become very sharp. They know, they are absolutely amazing at it too. You'll see a boost for a cy young candidate pitcher to get something like 4K against a struggling team and you think it's automatic but they somehow know the conditions line up for an outlier performance that day. You'll see it boosted on multiple books too and it's a sure sign to be wary.\n\nI still make dollar bets just to have a touch of skin in some games I want to watch but it's really just for fun and the balance stays even for the most part if you're being conservative. I don't know how anyone bets past house money offers and thinks they can get ahead, it's not a charity.\n",

				"Comment": "Exercise can be cheap. But, As an exercise addict... It can be very expensive. \n\nQuality running shoes are over 100 bucks and last me 4-5 months (400-500 miles). Plus you need shoes for pavement, and shoes for trails. Oh, and shoes for hiking. \n\nI'm an avid cyclist in addition to running. I bought a 550 dollar bike and put 20,000 miles on it. Then I bought an 1800 dollar racing bike. I figured that would be my last bike. But over time I switched from speed cycling to endurance cycling, and the racing bike was not comfortable for 3+ hour rides. So I dropped 4600 on an endurance bike. I absolutely LOVE that bike! Comfy for hours. Worth every penny. \n\nThen there's the outfits... Sure in the summer any shorts and T shirt will work for hour long runs or bike rides. But past that length you need better clothes that don't hold water and don't chafe. For cycling you need a pair of tight padded shorts. Then you need fall/spring weight clothing, and heavy clothing for winter, in addition to your summer clothing. Luckily if you buy quality gear it will last years so the clothing is buy once cry once. \n\nOh, then I needed a bike rack for my car since I was sick of putting it in the trunk, so bust out another 800 for a tow hitch bike rack. Why not pick up kayaking too like I did? 300-800 for the kayak, 100-500 for the paddle. Gotta get cross bars for the car to put the kayak on, so that's another couple hundred. LoL! It really adds up! \n\nAll that being said... I totally agree with you. Exercise is a cheap addiction. But, it's a slippery slope to going from cheap to being mad expensive. I did cheap (550 dollar bike, 50 dollar running shoes, no special clothing) for years before I decided I want to push myself hard. That's when it got expensive. The expense was worth it though! 340 pounds down to ideal weight (210 pounds, 6'4\"), and I've kept the weight off for years. Best addiction I've ever had!\n",

It is nice to hear the doctor say \"don't lose any more weight\" instead of always hearing \"you need to lose over 100 pounds\". \n\nMy massage therapist is making a killing off me though hahaha! Each time I do a long race/competition, I always schedule time with him for the next business day. It is expensive but he can take me from \"everything in my lower body hurts\" to \"I'm going to do a quick 10k when I get home from this appointment\" in an hour. It's magic. Expensive, but magic.\n",

Some people have great technical skills for their roles and zero people skills - but if you're moving into something like project management, you need some people skills. \n\nThere is a term for folks promoted out of their skill range: \"promoted to the level of their incompetence.\" And boy, does it show with some of them.\n\nNot saying all promotions are fair - certainly not. A lot of them stink. But sometimes people think they should get a promotion just because they've put time in when they are not the best person for the job.\n",

Apparently she had only just been diagnosed earlier that year. Earlier in the year, when her husband got the news that she had cancer, he was on his way home to comfort her and was killed in a car accident. So these boys lost both their parents in the span of about 10 months. This woman not only found out she was dying, but then was loaded with the grief of his death and the uncertainty of her children's futures. All of us nurses had to rotate care of her, as no one could leave that room and not be in tears. We didn't want to add to the boys grief.\n\nLife is fucked sometimes.\n",

We were all sad, and tried our best to help him, including the teachers. He was understandably sad, but they'd known she wasn't going to survive for a while at that point, so he was doing pretty good (as much as it was possible).\n\nThen, on the morning of the first exam, his father suddenly died. He was healthy as far as anyone knew. No warning whatsoever to an already grieving family (my classmate was the oldest of 3, barely 18). The boy came in for the exam to the surprise of everyone, but just sat there frozen, not writing a single thing on his paper. He obviously failed that first exam, but somehow rallied and passed the other three over the next 2 weeks. \n\nAll of us, the teachers and the principal helped him prepare for his do-over exam a month later so he could graduate on time with all of us. It was the least we could do. \n\nLast I heard, the kid's grandparents took them in, and the boy was able to go to a local university. But I can't imagine what he went through. It was bad enough to have to watch his mum die an agonizing death, but to then lose his dad so suddenly so soon after is just fucked up.\n",

But there were other, smarter, better educated people under him who probably could do a better job. I’m convinced that a major reason he was in that position was because he would look good on a “who we are” page of executives.\n",

We all have different things going for us and it's somehow evens out. That seemed to be what you would get from TV sitcoms and from the self-esteem talks in school and from parents.\n\nLife has taught me that is not true. Cindy Crawford was an engineering major and an honor student. I worked at a bookstore on an Ivy League campus and we would have students come in who would look like supermodels, be very kind, be very charming and clearly were very smart because they were students at an ivy League college. There are some people who have it all: Good looks, intelligence, charisma, kindness, charm, warmth, etc. And unfortunately there are some people in the other direction to.\n",

Her mother had her on both amphetamines and sleeping pills before she turned ten. Then MGM studio executives turned up the pressure:\n\n\nBy the time 17-year-old Garland finished filming Oz, she was already addicted to barbiturates and amphetamines. Her use of the drugs had started before the actress slipped into those ruby slippers, in part due to studio bosses who demanded she remain thin, and energetic enough to cope with arduous days of filming. source.\n\n\nThey also hooked her on tobacco cigarettes and gave her an eating disorder.\n\n\nStudio head Louis B. Mayer and the MGM bosses were reportedly already worried about any extra weight on the diminutive star, going so far as to refer to her as a “fat little pig with pigtails.” Placed on what would be the first of many diets, Garland’s food intake was severely restricted and monitored closely. To maintain her weight, Mayer insisted she consume only chicken soup, black coffee and cigarettes, along with pills to reduce her appetite. \n\n\nIn her own words, \n\n\n“They had us working days and nights on end. They’d give us pills to keep us on our feet long after we were exhausted [benzedrine]. Then they’d take us to the studio hospital and knock us out with sleeping pills­ [barbiturates] – Mickey [Rooney] sprawled out on one bed and me on another,” Garland told biographer Paul Donnelley. “Then after four hours they’d wake us up and give us the pep pills again so we could work 72 hours in a row. Half of the time we were hanging from the ceiling but it was a way of life for us.”\n\n\nShe died of an accidental overdose in her forties.\n",

But even decades later when she was a mature adult and had completely different tastes in media, culture & celebrities (and was no longer anorexic), she still had pretty disordered eating, a very poor relationship with her self image and was constantly falling victim to fad diets (i.e. the cabbage soup diet, detox diets, slimming teas diets, etc). She was never actually fat, instead yo-yoing between the high & low ends of the healthy BMI range, but she would never view herself that way at all; if she was at a high end she would view herself as way too big, and at a low end? It wasn't good enough unless she was positively underweight. \n\nI don't think a lot of people realise how common too it is for eating disorders and poor self image outlooks to get passed down from parents to children as well.\n",

I watched her grow up and her career take off in the photos he had all over the office walls. He proudly beagged about her and shared surprisingly candid stories about her experiences. \n\nMy last appointment with him before he retired, this usually chipper and outright fun doc was much more glum. “Don’t let your kids get into show business. It ruins them.”\n\nEdited to copy and paste this more detailed comment I made 8 months ago (when she was found naked and wandering the streets): \n\n“Oh no. :(\n\nI’ve shared this before—Amanda’s dad was my family dentist for years and I graduated high school with her older brother. We watched Amanda grow up in pics on the walls of Doc Bynes’s office, eventually seeing her career take off. He had one wall dedicated to her selfies with various stars on the red carpet—I remember Phil Hartman, Dustin Hoffman, and Frankie Muniz distinctly—and it was always fun to see the newest additions to the collection.\n\nDoc retired when Amanda started her movie career, but not before he spontaneously and rather ominously told me at my last appointment, “Don’t let your kids get into show business, Ruffffian. It ruins them.”\n\nDoc Bynes and his wife (the receptionist for his practice) were always so kind and generous to my family. Doc was particularly tender with my father, whose many health issues made for many dental complications. I know Doc saw my dad more than once on the weekends, when the office was closed. Mom and Dad both talked about how genuinely kind Doc was. He was like a favorite uncle for me.\n\nNow, I only knew him in one capacity so who knows what he was like as a parent and in other aspects of his life. But every time I hear of Amanda’s mental illness-related issues, and see the media’s feasting on them, my heart breaks for her parents. Well, and her too.”\n",

The worst of which was a back surgery, which was a major contributor to excluding him from the action centric roles for which he was being typecast.\n\nThe court ruling of his already proceeding divorce had issued a burden of spousal support based on his projected earnings. With his career progression now interrupted by injury, and unable to get adjestments made to his alimony payments, he had to start taking whatever work he could get. Which was dictated by the perception at the time that Brendan was a himbo, and couldn't carry a movie as the lead if it wasn't action based. Of course, now the perception has shifted and we know that Brendan is a great actor. But that does not grant him back that lost time.\n",

He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\n\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\"\n",

Take toilet paper for example. You may pay less for 4 rolls at Dollar General, but a 4 pack at Walmart is better quality and has around twice as many sheets. So while you are paying more per roll at Walmart you are also getting almost twice as much actual paper, so you end up paying less per sheet at Walmart.  \n\nI checked over 300 items, and slightly less than 90% of the items I checked cost more per volume at Dollar General than comparable items at Walmart. The ones that were less expensive tended to be stuff like coffee mugs, sunglasses, and other non-necessities. When it came to necessities then the prices were usually lower per package, but the prices were higher per gram. So things like Dish Soap were cheaper by the bottle at Dollar General, but were higher priced per ounce.  \n\nIt might be that this has changed since I wrote that paper in 2010. It might also be that you live in an area where Walmart has higher prices, or Dollar General has lower prices, than where I was (Chicago) when I wrote that paper.\n",

I was penalized because I wasn't a crack head - just saying) - anyway, my daughter changed career choice and we paid out of pocket semester by semester, I put it on credit card, took out of my meager savings, etc.  BUT - we got through. She just graduated with not student loan debt. She owes the bank of Mom, but, I am in no rush.  I pay my bills and have just enough to get by, and am finally back in college myself and almost finished with my first degree.

Cost of literally everything has increased significantly since then.\n\nFortunately, some cities and states have begun implementing new minimum wages, and a lot of min wage jobs like the fast food industry have also increased their wages to a more respectable $10+/hr, but until there is a fed law that increases the min wage in relation to inflation on an annual basis, the current wages people are getting today will be insufficient within 5 years.\n\nBecause of this model, low wage workers are almost never able to accumulate any type of asset...real estate, retirement plans, investments, etc.  They rent and can only generally only afford things that depreciate in value.\n",

				"Comment": "Raises for low earners are in general smaller than raises for high earners, which fuels deeper income inequality and struggles. \n\nSomeone making $10 an hour who gets a 5% raise is going to make $10.50 an hour afterwards, or fifty cents more. I work in government IT and get 5% raises annually. I currently make effectively $53.13, and my next step will put me at $55.78. Same 5%, but that's $2.65 more an hour. \n\nLets say the hypothetical person and I both spent the same on groceries per month, $300. Grocery prices went up 10.4% in 2022, so our bill went from $300 to $331, or $31 dollars more a month. Hypothetical's raise of $.5 across 80 hours a month is $40, leaving him with only $9 left to deal with whatever else increased that year. My raise was worth $212 a month, so I have $181 left over to deal with other rising costs. \n\nThis is why income tax is a thing, why higher brackets should pay more, and why we need even more brackets above what we have now at even higher rates. Above $1.5 mil should be 45%, above $10 mil should be 55%, above $50 mil should be 75%. Once you hit those income amounts you are profiting off the stability of society. Your workers AND customers use social programs, education, streets and infrastructure to create and enable the system that makes you money and you should be responsible to help pay for it.\n",

				"Comment": "When you struggle to afford healthy food, so you find your energy levels and general feeling of health depleting over time. You have to work hard to survive but never feel like you're working at your optimum thanks to a low quality diet. You then find yourself more susceptible to falling ill more often but even after taking time off (which you can barely afford) you don't have the proper nutrition to get well quickly. \n\nAnd this all has real impacts; people judge on whether you look old and out of shape, they notice the bags under your eyes, the sick days you take and the general lack of pep in your step. So you get passed over for promotions and relegated to poorer roles. And the opposite sex also notices your mediocre health and lack of gusto, so they pass you over too. And all these things impact on the cycle of poverty you're trapped in, which tends to get worse as time goes by thanks to things like the cost of living crisis.\n\nThere's a lot of truth to the saying that \"Health is wealth\", but few people tend to understand the real ramifications of this, especially in terms of the poverty cycle.\n",

				"Comment": "Underrated point. I grew up rural poor, and ended up urban upper-middle class. The first difference I noticed when I finished grad school and got my first engineering job was how much younger everyone looked than people of the same ages back home. I noticed this among my partner's generational wealthy family as well. Surely some people are getting things like botox and fillers, but it goes way beyond that. It's the overall health of people who can afford to eat well and go to the gym, it's the fact that they've all had dental care all their lives. \n\nIt made me think of when my mother finished her degree in her late 40's, and couldn't get a job. She was competing with 22-year-olds from good families (in a small town, that sort of thing matters) and looked completely haggard by that age. Ageism is definitely an issue in hiring even now, and people who are poorer look older on average than those who have never struggled significantly, so they are disproportionately affected by that ageism.\n",

Got two tickets and couldn't afford to pay the tickets on time because my car was totaled which cost me a lot of money. After failing to pay tickets on time, my license was suspended. Got another ticket for that while driving to work to make money to pay the original tickets. After paying off all my tickets, late fees, and license renewal, I was out almost $900 dollars. So 2 tickets that were originally about $400, became $900 because poverty? At the same time was juggling utilities bills. Can't afford your electricity? Well now pay it with late fees and reactivation fees. Somehow the answer to being poor, is to be charged more money for shit you 100% need to survive that you temporarily couldn't afford to begin with.

				"Comment": "Credit score had nothing to do with any of this. A finance manager's JOB is to get as many buyers financed, in the manner that will make his employer, the dealer, the most profit possible. If you do your due diligence, and get pre-qualified for a loan from a bank or credit union before you walk in the door, you know that you are going to be eligible for a competitive rate, based on your income, expenses and credit score.\n\nSo, in my case, my local credit union will give me a 4 year car loan at 7.14%. If I stumble into a dealership and make it clear that I am unprepared to do business, they might sit me down and tell me that \"the best we can do is four years at 9.99%.\" Believe me, they are going to make a fuckton of money on that loan.  But if I don't have a clue how any of this works, and bite on that 9.99% loan, I am the idiot, not the dealer. The fact that they lowered the rate when you discussed a co-signer is because they were trying to get a feel for how much you knew, and how much they could overcharge you for the loan. If you had just said, \"No, I'm not paying that rate\" they would have lowered it to the point where you bit, or they couldn't go any lower, since that was where their bank was at on the deal. The fact that they lowered your payment, may or may not mean that you won, as it frequently means they used another technique to screw you.\n",

And the crappy shoes last him about a season before they wear out. And then next season he has to buy another pair of crappy shoes. And he spends a lot of the end of that year with wet feet and being miserable and cold. \n\nIf he could afford to spend just a little bit more money, he could get nice shoes that last 3 years. And then he could spend all that extra shoe money on something else. But he can't afford the nice shoes.  So he ends up spending almost three times as much on shoes.\n\nIt's about how much money you have at one time.\n\nAnother great example is medical expenses. If you're poor, you can't necessarily afford to go to the doctor every time something bothers you. You can't afford to get your cough looked at and get your mouth pain looked at and get your ear pain looked at. Because that's three visits to the doctor and you can only afford one. So you have to wait until one of those things gets really bad. And by the time that one thing is really bad, it's probably a complicated infection that you end up having to spend more money on and now you're in debt.\n\nWhere is a rich person? Just went to the doctor three times, and in the end they spent less money on the doctor, because they caught that thing in their job before it became a full infection. But the trick is you would have to know which one of those three things is the right thing to spend money on in order to have the same effect.\n",

Doing minimum payments, you end up paying $2,332.19 in total. This is over double causing prices to be extra high.\n\nIf you always do minimum payments, you're paying over 2x for everything. If you then fall behind on that and need to do a payday loan, you can easily get into the 10x range.\n\nIf you pay in full and have a rewards card, you can get $20 back and end up only spending $980 for your $1,000 purchase.\n",

The other team runs and hides somewhere in the neighborhood.  If they get found and tagged they have to go back to the jail.  You can break out your team if you manage to run all the way across the driveway and yell \"JAILBREAK\" without being tagged by a guard.  We did an hour game each side and then switched.  You win if you put everyone on jail or if you last the entire hour without getting caught.  Best out of three.\n\nNo phones, this was generally an after dinner game so we'd be running around until like 9 or so, nobody cared.  Nobody came looking for us, nobody called the cops.\n\nLiterally running around in people's yards hiding in bushes and behind cars.  You'd be lucky these days to not get shot doing that, very different times I guess.  I grew up in Illinois.\n",

It’s rare to see children out and about playing in the streets, even more so teenagers. My daughter doesn’t know any of the local kids, and to be fair, I don’t know any of the adults. I used to play games like you described with all the kids in my neighbourhood and times have changed so much in the past 20-30 years that those things just don’t happen anymore. It’s really sad.

We spent all of that Friday and Saturday on our bikes riding around and just doing the things that kids our age did.  The best part was that none of us went out looking for each other that day, I was already out on my bike and the 2 of them were together and told me to come hang with them, and then it just turned into us hanging out for 2 days.

If you missed an episode, you were a social outcast for a day\n\nIt was such a big deal that one day when there was a black out in town, this one kid became the coolest kid in class because he had such a long commute to school that he'd been the only person unaffected by the blackout and he got to see the episode.\n\nSince internet wasn't as widespread back then and kids certainly weren't hanging on discussion forums, all us kids gathered around the Chosen One, the kid who saw the episode, and had  him explain what happened in it, as if huddling around the fire at camp. \n\nThis sort of cult following of a TV-show doesn't exist anymore because kids have way more options now and don't all have to gather around the tv at the exact same time to watch the exact same show\n",

If you're a prehistoric society and you have oral tradition it's pretty much a guarantee that one of the biggest events in your tribal history was the 500yr flood that fucked more or less everyone in your geographic area. Especially considering that a huge number of early civilizations started in flood plains of the various great rivers. It would be weirder if there wasn't a story about a major flood in a given civilization. It's just about the most widely shared experience of humanity besides the sun and death.\n",

Floodplains were often fertile grounds for settlement, but they came with the risk of catastrophic floods. It's fascinating how these shared experiences shaped cultural myths and legends, becoming a universal theme in human history. Flood stories serve as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of communities in the face of natural challenges. The interplay between geography, oral tradition, and the collective human experience is truly remarkable.\n",

				"Comment": "The Younger Dryas (from my notes):\n\nA Chilly Interlude in Earth's Climate History\n\nImagine you're finally getting out of your winter coat and enjoying the warm spring weather when suddenly, you're hit with a blast of cold air. That's kind of what happened to Earth about 12,900 years ago, during a period called the Younger Dryas.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a brief but dramatic cooling event that interrupted the gradual warming trend following the last Ice Age. It lasted for about 1,300 years, from roughly 12,900 to 11,700 years ago. During this time, temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere dropped by an average of 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit), plunging parts of Europe and North America back into near-glacial conditions.\n\nWhat Caused the Younger Dryas?\n\nScientists are still debating the exact cause of the Younger Dryas, but one of the leading theories involves a massive freshwater discharge into the North Atlantic Ocean. This freshwater influx is thought to have weakened the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a giant ocean current that helps regulate Earth's climate.\n\nThe AMOC is like a giant conveyor belt that transports warm water from the tropics to the Northern Hemisphere. When the AMOC weakens, less warm water reaches the north, leading to colder temperatures.\n\nHow Did the Younger Dryas Affect Humans?\n\nThe Younger Dryas had a significant impact on human societies around the world. The sudden cooling and drying of the climate disrupted agriculture and hunting, leading to food shortages and population declines.\n\nIn Europe, many Mesolithic hunter-gatherer groups abandoned their traditional settlements and moved to more sheltered areas. Some groups even reverted to a more nomadic lifestyle.\n\nIn North America, the Younger Dryas may have contributed to the decline of the Clovis culture, one of the earliest known human cultures in North America.\n\nGraham Hancock has speculated it was responsible for the demise of an advanced civilization which, when fully exhumed, may rewrite human history.\n",

The Turkish government at the time was controlled by Taihain Shygmalzel, an ancient demon hell-bent on eradicating any other supernatural powers on the Instant Plane. Anyhow, the Theurges wrote in their own obscure script, and all but a few of them are dead now, so no one left on Earth is able to read it. You could try the Sanctum on Mercury, but I don’t know if Alara and Hastur even made it there alive, to say nothing of whether their spoiled brats were able to get a settlement going. They most likely fled to the Plane of Probability, or somewhere. And really, can we blame them?\n",

From 1933 to 1945 he did an annual speech on Hitler’s birthday, and comparing them was quite the ride and insightful if not Voyeuristic. Of particular interest was Goebbels’ 1945 birthday speech as it was mere days before Hitler and Braun killed themselves and before Goebbels and his wife killed their six children and themselves, but nonetheless promised victory and a super weapon, and cites the death of FDR as a sign of the hand of fate. The sportplatz Total War speech was a masterclass in rhetoric while being absolutely chilling. Sadly Mein Kampf was a shitty read of navel-gazing, ego-babble, false conclusions, and narrative acting.\n",

The explosion flattened an area of forest the size of a small city, and the shockwave was felt as far as 800 kilometers away. The event caused no known human casualties, but it remains one of the most mysterious and debated events in history.\n\nThere have been many theories about the cause of the Tunguska event, including a meteorite impact, an asteroid explosion, and a comet airburst. However, no definitive answer has ever been found. Knowing the absolute truth about the Tunguska event would help us to better understand the history of our planet and the potential hazards that we face from asteroids, comets, and other space objects.\n",

I don't think we have the capacity to understand, even if we were told. The Orville had a really interesting episode where they were caught in 2 dimensional space. They asked at one point whether they would be hurting the 2 dimensional world by travelling through it, someone replied that they wouldn't be able to detect a 3 dimensional ship, because they only know about their 2 dimensions. It was a good analogy I think for our lack of understanding so far.\n",

Both of those technologies have been investigated and have ultimately been found to not be very efficient as the energy required to split water into hydrogen and oxygen will always exceed the energy you can harness by recombining them and hydrogen is not dense at all as a gas so it would need to be liquified to have any decent range which requires high pressure. \n\nTo put it into simpler terms water is already one of the lowest energy products so you can’t break it to make more energy it’s why typical combustion generates co2 and h2O because both of those are very low energy products \n\nAlso for the conspiracy theory to get even more interesting, why wouldn’t a company like Exxon or shell have killed the guy but kept the technology and invested in it heavily made a bunch of patents so it looked like it was their idea and no one else could use it and then make power plants with the same technology and earn trillions since they could basically sell power that they get for free?\n",

After I finally moved to another company my overall quality of life increased substantially. Lower daily work stress made for a better work/life balance and I suddenly had the energy to tackle personal goals outside of work. It was pretty much a lateral move in terms of pay but it ended up being a much better job for me overall.\n",

But I could definitely point out ones that affected me negatively emotionally … and for what? The answer to my first question tells me “for nothing” … for no significant value any way. Stopped paying attention to as much as I reasonably could. Couldn’t believe the improvement I saw. A little bit of me feels “guilty” because things happen that do affect my world that I should be paying attention to and trying to stop in some way (or support in some way) … but the improvement in my mental health at least tells me I’m not there yet.\n\nIt’s had such an impact, I’m trying desperately to get my parents (currently in their 70s) to do the same.  I see their emotion, their anger, and it reminds me of me.  Your retirement doesn’t last until death … it lasts until your health starts to deteriorate and limits what you can do to enjoy your retirement. And that can happen well before death. I really do believe their consumption of news and news programs are slowly but surely deteriorating their mental health and similarly, then, effecting their physical health. I hope I can convince them of this before the end of their “retirement” … whichever end that will be …\n",

I am diagnosed with ptsd but because I built up a little tool box to deal with everything, most days I’m okay. \n\nThe other thing is exercise, healthy eating, getting enough sleep, CBT, and having a routine.

Do not seek out a relationship hoping the potential partner will \"make you happy\".\n\nAn old coworker told me \"No one wants to be around a miserable fuck all the time\".  Since that day, my mindset has completely changed.  I know how much energy it takes to feel so down on yourself.  It's mentally draining.  Why not use all of that energy towards something more meaningful/powerful?\n\nI can't tell you how to live your life, but I can speak from experience when I say that you WILL notice your friends/family fade away if you consistently complain about being miserable, but do nothing about it.  Yes, they may love you and support you, but you are selfish if you think they will fix you.  YOU are the variable.  Make the change, or I'm certain you will have regrets.\n\nNo one said it would be easy, by the way.  But I guarantee if you are able to make the change yourself, you will look back on that point in your life years down the road and think \"Wow, I was an idiot for thinking/acting like that\".\n\nBe happy, be positive, be friendly.  Yea there are assholes in the world, but that doesn't mean you have to be one.  Set your shitty views and opinions to the side for a moment.  Your political view isn't your personality.  Your favorite sports team isn't your personality.  You are a human.  You have feelings/emotions just like every other human in the world.  Do you really think you're going to agree with all 7 billion people in the world?\n\nFind the power in yourself to understand whatever your going through may be shitty, but you can ultimately change it.  Feel like it's out of your control?  Stop worrying about it then, if there is nothing you can do.\n\nI understand it's easier said than done, but get on with it then.  You afraid to be happy because it's \"hard\"?  That makes you sound like the biggest loser in the world, imo.\n",

I could write an essay on it but I'll muddle it down to the basics, it looks good first of all, it's a mentally pleasing thing to look at throughout the day, especially if you spend most of your time in your room like I do. I always say a clean physical space helps keep the mental space clean as well. It gets your first chore of the day done immediately, which makes further chores seem easier, and at the end of the day, no matter the day, you'll have done at least one good thing and you get to crawl into a nicely made bed which feels so much better each night than wrestling with a jumble of sheets and such. Please all, make your bed each day.\n",

If it’s friends or family, cautiously forgive and see if they were just in a bad spot.\n\nAlso recognize some people are deeply flawed and being cruel is their go to behavior. Forgiveness for them is just recognizing that being horrible is all they are capable of doing and has nothing to do with you or anything you do. Move on with your life and leave them out of it.\n",

You land on January 1st, find a quick and easy job, save up $50, put it on the Super Bowl, Cowboys over Steelers but more specifically 2+ interceptions by defensive player Larry Brown. \n\nThat right there will at least net you a significant return on the $50 you put in. From there start making investments, Amazon doesn’t go public until 1997, but Yahoo goes public in April of 1996. That’s your big investment until Amazon. \n\nNext thing to look at: cell phones. They’re on the cusp of breaking out into everyday tools in 1996, invest in major cellular services, they’re all about to boom. \n\nApple of course is an option but there is another.\n\nAssuming your visit to 1996 is permanent, you should be well off financially by 2000. As much as you may not want to for “moral reasons”, it’s time to invest in arms manufacturers because 9/11 is about to pop off and war is coming. I would not recommend investing in the tourism industry.\n\nAlso put money into the Bush campaign, you might get rewarded with an ambassadorship to some random country, might as well gamble right?\n\nFinally, buy a stake in google they’re about to go wild.\n\nYou should be a rich man within 10 years if you play it right.\n",

It was Ohio and so so so cold but a church group was giving out hot chocolate so that was nice. \n\nI was also THRILLED to get myself new towels at only $2 each. \n\nThe only time I did Black Friday shopping and it was worth it. \n\nThis comment ages me 😐\n",

Once that door opened it was like all my politeness and sensible decision making switched off and I was a caveman in pursuit of prey on a hunt. I shamelessly shoved my way in.

Peoples hands reaching out like they trying to get a football player to fumble the ball so they can intercept.\n\nI clenched the box to my chest and B lined it straight to check out. I got to my car and felt so fucking victorious. It wasnt until the drive home that I felt gross for doing it.\n\nBonus disappointment for all my efforts.

When I was a teen in the 90's, Black Friday was THE shopping event of the year for malls. Yes, there were good sales on high ticketed items. But that wasn't the only thing that brought people out. There would be tons of giveaways, contests such as scratch offs and spin the wheel for prizes and even food. Yes, food. Because all of the stores in the mall wanted you to stay and shop. So, platters of food samples would come around the shoppers for you to eat. You would start at one end of the mall, where many times there would be greeters at the doors handing out empty shopping bags for all of your \"goodies.\" And by the time you made it to the other side of the mall, you and your bag would be full. \n\nNow, I can't think of a single store let alone an entire mall that still does that. It was an amazing shopping experience back then. I, honestly, miss it.\n",

The deals aren't that good. There's no crazy 40-50% sales that made people nuts, and when those sales do exist they're on products nobody wants. Also people have gotten savvy to how retailers slowly hike prices in the weeks before BF just to \"put them on sale.\"\n\n3.) Black Friday isn't a single day.

Also, the discounts aren’t even the best discounts anymore. Often times I’ll find items were on sale for a lower price than Black Friday prices a few months beforehand. Finally, a lot of the stuff that is on sale for Black Friday is merchandise retailers specifically sell for Black Friday and is of subpar quality compared to other items. I guess businesses got smart and saw they were losing their asses in margins, so they brought in specific Black Friday merchandise that they can afford to “mark down” dirt cheap when in reality that’s what the product is worth anyways.\n",

So you would have to be strategic in where you went.\n\nThat meant every store competed for your choice with one crazy cheap item to convince you to go there that would sell out before you could get to a second store. Then once you were in the store you stayed for your Christmas shopping.\n\nWeb sales mean someone can be at 10 places at once. Completely destroyed the economics of a single loss leader. So a web store has no loss leader to write off and can lower their prices across the board. They're all competing on overall cart price not on one steep discount and a bunch of relatively lower clearance items.\n",

Okay...? No thanks, I'll just buy those digitally and not need to store them on a shelf (and cheaper at that, the digital game stores have a better discount right now). \n\nFYE had like one sign saying blankets were buy one get one 50% off... Ok lol\n\nand Walmart had nothing in the entertainment section, food, nothing marked down anywhere. I was shocked, honestly. I'm not so much shocked at the food situation, but nothing in entertainment marked down? Weird move.\n\nTarget was similar, I think they had buy two movies/books/music get one free and I think I saw holiday cat treats were 20 or 30% off. Big fucking deal\n",

At first it was a day, then it was a friday/monday, then it was a weekend, then it just gradually expanded outwards. \nA lot of products are sold at very low margins to begin with (think like, Xbox) and they expect to recoup money on the sale of addon packages.\n\n",

Everyone thinks lawyers want to drag it out, but if you actually care about your clients, or even just want referrals and repeat business, that’s rarely the case. Litigation is expensive, acrimonious, drawn out, and emotionally charged, and usually you’re better off finding a dispassionate settlement that you don’t particularly enjoy but lets you move on with your life. But no, it’s too important to most people’s egos to keep trying for that total victory. I always make the case for a reasonable approach but at the end of the day it’s the client’s case and the client’s money, so if they insist, that’s the plan.\n",

Til I started working with them and saw just how many issues were resolved by rebooting. Not just PC's but phones, tablets, printers, even desk phones. Nothing aggravated me more than when I asked if someone rebooted, they say ofc I did, you check the uptime, 65 weeks. Like you dragged me out here for nothing bc me restarting it fixed it. I don't do that now, I'm in application support but man... always shit me\n",

I don't remember what happened to the first one...

It seems like one of those careers like nursing and teaching where it beats down the good ones. She taught for low income pre-k for about 10 years after that and now works on the state side of the pre-k system so at least she’s still trying to help kids.\n",

Questions beget more questions. Lots of operational definitions needed. It gets very difficult even if the solution offered seems simple. And we would all presumably have different answers.

The kidnap and ransom thing in Thailand has gotten so out of hand that Chinese Malaysians are now too afraid to travel to Thailand because there's such a high probability of them being kidnapped. I'm not aware of it happening to other races, but it with the reduction in Chinese traveling to the country, they might very well start to abduct and ransom other races. For now, the people being enslaved for the Thai fishing industry are mostly from Myanmar, Bangladesh, or Rohingya fleeing genocide in Burma.\n",

A lot of non smokers diagnosed with NSCLC have a mutation (not necessarily inherited but a mutation within proteins in the cancer cells). My dad was just diagnosed with stage IV EGFR lung cancer .. has never smoked. And through that I’ve learned how often this is occurring in women.. particularly Asian women. I talked with a 28 year old woman who was just diagnosed with stage IV EGFR .. she had been going to dr for two years prior complaining of symptoms and drs said it was asthma and never gave her a scan.. 2 years later.: stage IV. Could have been caught earlier. Same with a woman i befriended.. 35 .. brushed off for a year by drs. PCPs need to be aware this is happening so they take patients seriously with persistent symptoms. If you google lung cancer on the rise in young women..you will see NYT and other outlets recently covered this.\n",

I guess the thing that is so alarming about lung cancer in never smokers is we are often taught that lung cancer is a cancer we can protect ourselves from.. that it’s “self inflicted” through smoking. If you asked me five months ago.. “do non smokers .. in their 30s/40: get lung cancer?” I would have said  “ya sure anything is possible.. but prob hardly ever.” Boy, was I wrong. The sad part is .. lung cancer is the #1 cause of cancer death in both men and women in the US.. but it is severely underfunded .. likely due to the stigma/ associations made with the disease. No one deserves cancer. No ones family deserves cancer . It is agony.. but on the flip side .. I wish more people knew this does happen quite often to people who don’t smoke etc. maybe if public perception could change .. this disease would get fair amounts of research funding\n",

I canned, pickled, and froze a lot of what my husband and I couldn't eat. I realize that 75 lbs. is not enough food to sustain two people for a year, but if everybody who owned a house with a patch of dirt did this, it would definitely add up. I'm looking into making my entire backyard into a permaculture food forest eventually. Hypothetically, if done right, I would never have to buy produce from a store again if I didn't want to. Having grass is such a waste of time, space, and water - not to mention it's bad for biodiversity. (And don't get me started on chemical pesticides and weed killers!) My husband doesn't care what I do with the backyard, but he's hesitant to do the permaculture thing in the front yard. I showed him some lawn alternatives recently and he seems open to compromising on a clover or creeping thyme \"lawn\" in the front yard along with dwarf fruit trees. I would also like to connect our rain gutters to barrels so we can use stored rain water and use it for our fruits and vegetables. I have been composting for years and I might try my hand at vermiculture (starting a worm farm) in the spring. Hopefully, that should take care of all my fertilizer needs. I would love to have some backyard chickens for egg laying and manure, but I don't think our town would allow that.\n",

You can't find almost any information about facilities on their websites (price? that's pretty much never accurately listed). That means you have to make calls. A lot of calls. If they're small you sometimes get who you need. Most of the time you get a number and have to leave a message or you get someone who can give you no info over the phone and have to leave a message. Sometimes you get some info from someone but then they don't know costs as you have to talk to the marketing department which is another number you call that no one answers. There are these websites that help you with the process for a cut, but no one tells you you lose bargaining power but being referred to homes. The whole industry revolves around referrals. If you call a place and they're out of your budget they'll then start asking your budget and want to help. They really want you to give the homes their name as person who referred you. Or they'll say you need a Medicare specialist to change your loved ones insurance, and then give you their name for the referral. Memory Care is also bananas expensive (I'm talking about $6,000 a month if sharing a room and looking at cheaper places). Medicare doesn't cover any of it. Abuse is unfortunately not uncommon.\n",

				"Comment": "It is very polluting to extract. Creates a lot of CO2 and pollutes both ground and air. HOWEVER, this lithium is what is used for rechargeable batteries. The goal is to both recycle them and make them durable.\n\nHere's a situation that was shown at my engineering school to demonstrate how they can be used.\n\nImagine a graph. Y axis is the pollution over time, and X is time. Line 1 (Combustion car) starts about 1/4 in height, and Line 2 (EV car) starts at 1/2. The slope of Line 1 is more steap than Line 2.\nAt a certain time, they touch.\n\nIf you keep an EV car for longer than that time, you effectively polluted less than a normal car. This is true IF the EV car uses renewable or green energy.\n\nThe best solution is to find a sweet spot between both so we reduce fossil fuel without creating another environmental problem.\n\nIf I had to ask to choose either a costly rechargeable battery or several cheap one use batteries for your phone that you use daily, what would be the best option?\n\nAlso, keep in mind that fossil is used once since you have to burn it.\n\nTLDR; While it is polluting, we use lithium longer than fossil fuels, and if managed properly, it can be better in certain cases.\n\nEdit:\nIn response to the comment above about it being the worst energy production, Lithium is not an energy source, it holds energy. That's what a battery is meant for. His point is right, but also wrong.\n\nI also want to add that decisions on what to use are related to engineering.\n\nAs for the answer to the phone question, it depends. If your phone only lasts a week before you need a new one, the disposable batteries would be cheaper.\n\nIf you can, please recycle both batteries and electronics to where they take them. Not in the recycle bin, at the convenient location. Search online to know where you can recycle them.\n",

In some countries the majority of short distance travel is done by bike. The problem with bikes is two fold, firstly there isn't suitable infrastructure to support them in most places, and secondly some people are required to travel too far for a bike to be reliable. These are both solvable problems, but will take throwing modern economics out the window if we want to successfully implement the solutions. Of course bikes are just one small part of the big picture.\n\nI'm far from the first to say it, but I have no doubt that our current capitalist mode of production is incompatible with sustainable living. We need to rethink what is a necessity and what is just nice to have. We should be living in much smaller communities, focused on sustainable food production.\n",

Why wouldn't the Chinese government take the opportunity to shift public sentiment in strategic spots with their control.

When, no joke, I was probably running off 2-3 hours of broken sleep for 3 months. It was so bad--I don't think I was hallucinating-- but I did start to believe our house was haunted 😂.

Like 30-50% of the videos I'd see looking over shoulders was: family guy on the top half, with subtitles, subway surfer on the bottom half, and a robot voiceover about some random bullshit with subtitles for that too. I think THAT does more damage than simply short videos, but the shorts format probably amplifys the damage, and the reward for posters of this garbage. It's a perfect self serving cycle\n",

It gives the government too much power, and doesn't address the root of the problem.\n\n2: A targeted ban like this will not actually accomplish anything. There are already too many clones of it, like Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels, and there won't be much stopping bytedance from releasing TikTok 2 or something that does the exact same thing but with a new name. \n\n3: Much of the reasoning the government is giving for this ban is hypocritical or aimed in the complete wrong direction. Data theft is already done heavily by US companies and sold to China anyways, banning TikTok will not prevent this. \n\nA much better solution would be a law which functions similar to the GDPR, requiring services to ask for consent to store data, as well as a ban on algorithmic content recommendation for minors. However, that would harm US companies, who are the ones who really want this ban to happen.\n",

I don’t see why I should be concerned about a foreign company having data that Facebook and Twitter also have. I’m concerned ANY of them have it, not that one in particular does\n\n\nstupid teens are doing stupid things and TikTok is practically encouraging them to do it!\n\n\nYeah man, we never heard stories of teenagers doing stupid things before TikTok came around, and certainly not prior to the internet /s. \n\n\nit’s different now with TikTok!\n\n\nIt’s not \n\n\nit shortens their attention span!\n\n\nYeah man, we definitely don’t have studies showing that attention spans are shortening well before TikTok came out/s\n\n\nit shortens it more than the others!\n\n\nOh, so we’re chill with the other social media apps shortening attention spans, but this one is doing it too well? By how much can they shorten attention spans before we start caring? Give me some hard numbers\n\nAt the end of the day, virtually every complaint people have against TikTok is something that we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that other social media apps are also doing or are things that we just know they already do. I’m sure we’ve all used incognito mode for something only to then be shown related ads or have spoken about something with someone and then get shown ads for those things. \n\nI’m concerned about all of these same issues. But I know the problem won’t be solved by just regulating one out of the wider market or by banning it. The issues are only going to be solved if we actually with them. All banning TikTok is going to do is allow the issues to be swept under the rug and then companies here get to do whatever they want, which is the same exact shot TikTok is doing anyway.\n\nIf the government won’t take the issue seriously and is just going to deal with one company so that the rest of them have less competition for our data, then why the fuck should I care? I’ll keep using TikTok and all the rest until I actually see a concerted effort to deal with the issue at hand\n",

The bigger issue is the mental health issues it has been proven to exacerbate, through its culture and its design. Both of these are issues that a ban would effectively solve. \n\nTiktok, moreso than any other social media platform to date, romanticizes and actively encourages both mental illness and actual crime. To the point where a substantial amount of people have literally built careers that make more money than most entry-level jobs, by displaying mental illness online, not even in a “here’s how you can manage it effectively” type of way, just sympathy-baiting or virtue-signaling for clout.\n\nNot to mention trends like the “Kia Challenge” or “Devious Lick”, which were just actual crimes, that many people did, and posted online, purely for internet points.\n\nAnd of course, the short-form videos, the algorithm designed to drip feed dopamine in order to keep people scrolling for hours, explosive nature of people’s rise to internet fame on the platform constantly baiting everyone to post, post, post, post, post, and you could be the next Charlie D’amelio or whatever her name is. It’s all forming an addiction to the platform, very effectively. \n\nNot to mention the rampant pedo-baiting of 14 year olds doing “dances” that are overtly sexual but not technically porn, and of course the adhd that everyone seems to have who uses it because of many very obvious reasons.\n\nIt’s bad. It’s real bad. It should’ve been banned 5 years ago. But it should absolutely be banned full stop asap\n",

Also because it's an authoritarian dictatorship it's inherently evil. \n\n\nexcept for their posturing in the South China Sea which is fairly benign considering their size and influence. \n\n\nUm, deliberately intruding into other countries' territorial waters and bullying them is benign? Are you hearing yourself? \n\n\nthey're no longer challenging to usurp the US as a global economic or military power.\n\n\nOkay, your entire comment is utter ignorance and bullshit. Search laowhy86 on YouTube and educate yourself. China would absolutely usurp the US if they were allowed to, and would happily bully other countries into submission, and make the scenario from 1984 come true in real life.\n",

Israel provides their neighbors (who constantly attack them) with healthcare and medical support, despite their neighbors just wanting to destroy their country (this was quite literally stated in Hamas's charter; their goal is to kill every Jew). It's absolutely heartbreaking and awful how the narrative lies to people and makes Israel seem like the enemy when it's Hamas, the terrorist organization that uses Palestinian people as human shields.\n",

				"Comment": "I used to work at a daycenter for adults with physical & mental disabilities and from hearing people's stories, very much this. Most people who there were wheelchair-bound, and by far the most common cause of the varying levels of paralysis that people suffered was strokes, it was a real eye-opener into not just how common a cause of disability strokes were (and how common strokes were in general), but also how young strokes could happen to people, with some people suffering them as young as their 30s or 40s.\n\nThe youngest guy at the center was a dude who had a stroke at only age 28/29 after becoming morbidly obese, drinking & smoking too much, he was in his 30s when I met him and he was very open & vocal to others about not repeating his mistakes. I was only age 23 when I signed up to work there and I was shocked to not only see so many people who'd suffered such life changing disabilities practically overnight, but ones at ages that were barely 10 years off my own (or less!). I was slim and very fit but it really hit home to me that I couldn't abuse my youth forever (i.e. at the time I smoked and ate a lot of junk food) and it definitely prompted me to start changing my lifestyle for the better.\n\nBarely a few years later, an older friend of mine who was a chunky lad who enjoyed his beers & bacon sandwiches had a huge heart attack and ended up having to have open heart surgery, he almost died multiple times on the operating table and (even though I'd heard of a lot of similar stories whilst at the daycenter job) it was still very shocking to see someone I actually personally knew almost die in their 30s due to poor lifestyle choices.\n\nDisability sucks on so many levels, it's not just a huge cause of divorce & poverty, but people also very commonly discriminate against and belittle disabled people in society, I wouldn't wish a serious disability on anyone.\n",

I'm sincerely sorry for your loss, but incredibly pleased she had you by her side.\n\nMy ex left the day he realised I'd never be \"normal\" again. I did try again with someone new years later, but he opted out, too. Yes, both deeply painful, but I also understand. \n\nThe sheer physical, emotional, financial, and mental toll can be simply overwhelming. The relationship becomes a balance where there can be resentment over the role of carer vs spouse, and on the other hand, so much guilt about being a burden.\n\nMedications, pain, illness, and functional changes impact personality, mood, and behaviour and other aspects of mental health. It can be tough, especially without the benefit of history as a couple during healthier times.\n\nWherever life meets you now, I hope you know health, joy, and peace. 🌟\n",

				"Comment": "I worked for a company that was commissioned to do moderation for TikTok.\n\nThe app isn't just unhealthy for its users; its parent company, Bytedance, is downright negligent and have zero interest in protecting their most vulnerable users, particularly children. This could be said for any social media company I'd wager, but thanks to my personal experiences with Bytedance, I can confidently say that their moderation teams are only in place to check a box so that they aren't run out of business by lawsuits or, in countries that actually give a shit and haven't been rendered utterly brain-dead by lobbying, federal regulation. Apologies for being on a tear about this, but it keeps coming up, because TikTok is a fucking plague on EVERY OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL. Reddit is a prime example of this, as I'm sure you've all realized by now. It's like a consumptive virus that cannot be cured because people are happy to continue sneezing into each other's open mouths.  \n\nWhen they have too much difficulty deciphering how to best apply guidelines and tags, ones that would actually result in permanent bans of toxic users, Bytedance would default to castrating whatever rule the users were consistently violating, because they're far more concerned about constant engagement than they are about maintaining any sort of standard. During my time working for them, they disabled several different tags that were CRUCIAL for moderation, the most notorious being the Reproduced Content tag, which is the only means we had of curtailing the comically rampant content theft that Bytedance implicitly supports. At another point, they combined a number of unique sexual content tags, turning them into all-encompassing generalizations that made them as vague as possible, because more explicit tags for things like the removal of clothing or the simulation of sexual acts would result in too many bans. Ironically, while they clearly did this because the more strictly definitive tags were hurting their bottom line, it also resulted in an uptick of bans on satire accounts or accounts posting suggestive, but not necessarily explicit, artwork. Yes, instead of pivoting in their approach or simply accepting that their moderation standards were, you know, working, they instead chose to muddle the waters so much that we were left with a pair of all-encompassing \"Sexualized Behavior\" tags that they then insisted we were overusing. We literally had no other choice if we wanted to tag these videos at all -- adults, teens and kids are CONSTANTLY trying to show skin on that app, and users of all ages are CONSTANTLY trying to encourage other kids to do the same, along with predators posing as children. Did it matter? Not at all. No matter what we reported back to them, Bytedance would never walk anything back. Quality accounts were needlessly warned or outright banned, while dangerous or at least apathetic accounts were allowed to skate by. \n\nFurthermore, unless an OBVIOUS CHILD, EVEN A TODDLER WEARING A DIAPER, actually comes out and reveals somehow that they are under 13 years of age (stating as much, revealing their grade in primary school or their birth date, showing their yearbook, etc.), there is nothing we can do besides tagging them as \"Suspected Underage\". What did this accomplish? Nothing. The account gets a warning, but no ban and no actual penalty. It's a fucking joke. \n\nTikTok is a predator's dreamland, and Bytedance would rather put children in danger than actually enforce their own fucking rules. People are idiots and parents are no different, so I have no hope that anything will change in the future, but I'm at least glad I'm not forced to endure watching TikTok videos for eight hours a day anymore. It was terrible for my mental health, and not just because I was usually dealing with the manual report queue where I would endlessly be subjected to seeing mutilated bodies or people brazenly posting child sexual assault material. I've seen a man cut his wrist open and then two other people stretched the laceration as wide as they could with their fingertips, right into the camera. I've seen a man's hand literally SHOVED OUT OF THE WAY by a bone shunted from his forearm, again, with the injury shoved right into the camera lens for my viewing pleasure. I've seen SO MANY PEOPLE get turned into human confetti by industrial lathes. I've seen animal mutilations that defy all rationale or explanation. I've seen more horrific, traumatizing abuse inflicted on very young children than I can even begin to describe. On the less violent side, you think people shilling their Only Fans accounts is bad here on Reddit? You have NO FUCKING IDEA how obnoxious, ubiquitous and BLATANT it was on TikTok. Between that and the ENDLESS FLOOD of crypto scams, fraudulent ads, targeted spam and poisoned links that were directed towards dumb kids that don't know any better, I simply can't even glance at a TikTok video without feeling revolted. Bytedance is an evil company, and they should be taken to court for crimes against humanity for what they've inflicted on the world. \n\nSeriously, fucking delete TikTok.\n",

Things like that were emerging on online platforms since dial up. That doesn't make it any better, but it's not surprising.\n\nI completely agree with the abandonment of most social media. I have little problems with Reddit, but any platform not anonymous just breeds mental health problems and yes, predatory behavior. Even Reddit isn't free from the addictive search for social reinforcement, but it's hard to make it your identity when nobody knows who you are. TikTok on the other hand... That is creating literal mental health problems that never existed in history. And we don't yet know how to deal with it.\n\nThe Internet in general is so enormously powerful and influential. Relative to the timeline of humanity (past and present), we are in our infancy with the internet. It's like handing a toddler a loaded gun. We will look back on the last 30 years someday and realize how irresponsible we were when we ......(fill in the blank). Social media and it's mental health influence over our youth and their development? Globalization and effects on the workforce? Undoubtedly a lot of good has come, but I'm not sure we have enough hindsight to see how much damage we have already caused.\n",

				"Comment": "Yup. When my grandmother was put into a care home (we had to- she had vascular dementia and it was more than what any of us could manage) I saw the plethora of elderly people who had been virtually abandoned there, never recieving any visitors.\n\nThere was even one old lady whose only son only came to visit her twice a year, he was apparently a wealthy banker who simply chose not to see his mother often but after those 2 fleeting visits around Christmas time (which he would treat like some mandatory thing that he was obligated to do- even when they ate together he would virtually do it in silence) she would then spend the next 363 days of the year sat by the window waiting for her son to next see her, it was really sad.\n\nI saw the same shit too when my grandfather was dying in hospital (endless abandoned or virtually abandoned old people dying alone in the wards), as well as in another care home when my other grandmother got Alzheimers. My formed impression is now very strong that it's actually the norm for people to get abandoned in old age (whether they have a good relationship with their families or not), people simply move on and move away in life and are lucky if they even live in the same country, county or state as their elderly relatives, let alone have the time & energy to visit them on a regular basis on top of full-time careers or raising young children.\n\nIf you don't want to end up along in old age, then don't rely on having children to keep you company- rely on having good friends (and stay as socially active as possible in old age) and make peace with the fact that most of us die alone regardless. The best you can often hope for is not a crowd at your bedside but a painless quick death after a long life well-lived, which is what is the most important thing (IMHO).\n\nI honestly don't see the point in trying to live it out after the diagnosis of dementia, a terminal illness or to the point that you are so frail & decrepit that you're barely functioning on a day-to-day basis and have lost most of your abilities (eyesight, taste, ability to walk or retain pee, Etc). None of my grandparents had any real quality of life after they reached these points of no-return, no matter how well we tried to look after them. So after seeing things play out with a number of relatives who reached advanced ages (90s), my partner & I have both agreed that although we'll try to look after ourselves as best we can so that we can live long happy lives together, once we reach critical points in old age we'll pay a visit to a Swiss clinic and go out together whilst still on a relatively high note rather than suffer a slow \"living death\" life Alzheimers or watch the other painfully waste away being eaten alive by cancer (Etc). To us both, it's not the quantity of life that counts the most, but rather the quality.\n",

				"Comment": "TBH, I'm not totally convinced about how healthy & genuine all that \"reverence\" actually is though. For example, at the same hospital my grandfather was dying in there was also an elderly Arabian dude dying in the same ward and one day what looked like his entire family came in to see him, except that for most of the relatives there (especially the younger ones) they all looked like they could have not given less hoots about the dying man and instead very much looked like they were only going through the motions of the visitation because they felt obligated to and had been dragged there by their parents or older relatives.\n\nOne of my friends at uni also came from a Moroccan Arabic family and I heard a lot about how toxic a lot of the traditions are (for example, how often stuff like domestic violence was swept under the carpet and how many women suffered loveless marriages or abuse because they feel they have no choice but too) and I know it is the same with a Nigerian friend of mine (also very family-orientated but very patriarchal, sexist and tradition-bound society), so I think that although your families are more bound together, they also aren't necessarily genuinely happier for it either.\n\nPersonally, I would rather be around people because they want to be around me (and vice versa), than to end up surrounded by people who are only by my side because they feel pressured/obligated to. I also believe that there is no fooling elderly people either, especially when they have lived to a near-century old; they know if you're going through the motions (and if you really care about them or not), elderly people always have things a lot more sussed out than relatives give them credit for.\n\nHonestly, what do you want to experience in old age?\n",

You actually do need to know how to do your job. You actually do need to learn the parenting techniques that work for you and your family to raise healthy happy kids. Etc etc. \n\nWhat you’re “faking” is confidence. You might be nervous to do something and worried you’ll mess up, but you forge ahead with your skills and educated assessments until you are no longer faking the confidence. You learn from your mistakes and you learn from others. You build experience and knowledge on top of what you know. \n\nSuccessful people do actually know what they are doing. Your surgeon doesn’t say “well no one really knows what they are doing lol.” A surgeon cannot promise you a great result but they are trained to take certain steps under the circumstances for that patient. This sort of things applies to all of us. \n\nIf you’re using these two phrases above as a way to not try very hard because “no one else knows what they are doing either” then you’re only fooling yourself. \n\nTaken appropriately, the advice is fine. But too many people fall back on these things as a way to excuse insecurity and failure. We all fail. We all worry we aren’t good enough. Success only comes when you realize that it’s actually attainable.\n",

Along with her rampage she would do whatever she could to try and get me to break but for my son “I can do this all day”. Obviously when I was sad I played a lot of video games and watched a lot of marvel movies. She only let me have him 2 days a week back then. Now I am the primary parent\n",

If you use this mantra you can ignore it lol.) In both situations i feel like a cooler person, so i put those two together and use it as a way to extend that mindset to everything i do. I want to eat a cookie? what would i do if i were made of gold? I've already had one, just gonna chill and walk around before going back to my room. No need to binge again. Looks like im gonna be listening to music all night and not get a good sleep? If i were made of gold id be well rested tomorrow.\n",

Make it count. \n\nYou can have big goals and aspirations, but true peace comes from contentment with where you are in the present moment. And that’s all about mindset, not circumstances. \n\nSomeone with an 85% chance of dying in the next five years is 100% alive today. Our lives aren’t valuable because of where we are or how we’re doing financially or what we’ve achieved or how much we’ve healed from our traumas or some bullshit guarantee that we’ll be here in a certain number of years. Our lives are valuable because we’re alive today.\n\nSo why let things bother you? Just go with the flow and be here now.\n",

If it's a robbery which means theft by force, weapon or not or if it's during closing hours which is burglary then you can shoot all you want in some states but if they're committing simple theft or larceny then your most likely going to be arrested in most parts of the US. It's kind of hard to justify shooting someone in the head for simple theft / larceny.\n",

Who can live with that kind of dark cloud over their head ,      and how you NOT see this and find fascination in shifting blame on responsibility  ,  the shooter is not the blame but not right either ,   there's no winner ,  100% pure example of all codes of life violated.   Theft,lies,deception,  murder,  withholding information, scandal , betrayal  , should I go on...   let me ask.

Apparently he’d gone to arrest a guy who was a serial abuser and had a LOT of prior calls for domestic disturbance, battery, etc. The wife never pressed charges, so the cops were always in a bind with this suspect. \n\nIn this instance, the cop arrived to the home, and the dude came at him with what “looked like a knife”… next thing you know the cop had unloaded a couple shots into him, and the guy died before making it to the hospital. \n\nAs the cop told me this, he was legit on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Shaking, tears in the eyes, labored breathing… the whole nine. This was during broad daylight in a pretty crowded outdoor bar patio… and I never even got this guy’s name.\n\nI have no idea if the shoot was justified, or what happened to that officer afterwards, but it’s always stuck with me.\n",

They still arrest. If both have marks you have to arrest both if they're not talking. They do it because they understand that people being abused often protect the abuser but then again I just realized this is Reddit and you might not be from the US. In the US if she had marks or even slightly suspected DV may have occurred the suspect would have to take the ride. It doesn't matter if she presses charges or not. In the US he would have been in jail all of the times they were called out unless this happened more than 25 years ago and not in the US.\n",

I’ll never forget that. And she starts making small talk and knowing how effed up my own life is, just…spills. Like I don’t know if I was her vessel, but she admits it and I just stare. My brothers and sisters in Christ, I was fuckin 14. No concept of how to process. Just said, I think I should get some sleep. Normally I crashed on the couch, but I woke my boy up and said, “I’m sleeping on the floor in here”. Like…that was non negotiable. She said it in a detached way that admittedly spooked me. And along with a lot of shit I saw and heard in my childhood/adolescence…I pretended it didn’t happen. Like I said, she was arrested a few weeks later. She actually died in prison a fairly recently. The other story, much less dramatic…sadly, my older buddy talking about how he shot a dope connect who tried to rob him. Sadly, I was almost in the crossfire when it happened in reverse to him.

Poor waiter was just staring. Very funny and not that big of deal, but still hilarious bc you wouldn't think she'd be into that at all. She was like 5 foot and her bf was like 6'3\", so the logistics could be hazardous.\n",

Several of us were spending the night at a mutual friends house since we all drank too much to drive.\n\nAnyways, I'm laying on the couch and she walks over and sits next to me while eating some plain white bread...she couldn't get enough of this sugary American treat lol. She told me she was happy that her dad died and then tried to have sex with me. I don't remember what I said to stop that situation, but I was definitely terrified (probably irrationally, but she had the crazy eyes) that she was going to either kill me or put a finger up my butt.\n",

We found my dad's fetlife account. Cringe, barf, ugh. \n\nYears pass. I'm out at a festival with my best friend since middle school. Totally unprompted, she chuckles and says \"Yknow, I never told you about your dad messaging me on fetlife, did I?\" She was probably 20 when it happened. He wasn't directly creepy, he offered to answer any questions she had, but still gave her way too much info by saying he'd been \"a professional Dom for 30 years\" (bitch no one would ever pay to sleep with you). And you just... don't put someone in that situation.\n\nI saw red. It very nearly ended in a fist fight when I confronted him, mostly my fault. \n\nYeah... bad day. Really bad day.\n",

I don't know why this keeps happening. I have asked my male friends if I give off some kind of weird vibe and they are totally confused. Maybe it's because I don't dress in pink frills and go teeheehee the whole time and order a salad with the croutons on the side and a glass of water. I guess I'm not standard girl enough so there's only two options. And if I'm not that one I must be a dominatrix 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ \n\n(I'm not by the way. I just like eating actual food)\n",

It will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another. By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that little things in life matter. If you can’t do the little things right, you will never do the big things right. And, if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made—that you made—and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.

They won't change and magically understand they were wrong. \n\nIt also took me to live abroad and far away from her for 5 years to see that she has an influence on my mental health even from that distance.

				"Comment": "I had a fairy tale reconnection with a boy I had met and had a mutual crush on. And then he was murdered. TW violence, suicide mention\n\nI went into an inpatient psych facility when I was 16. Just some good old suicidal ideation. I met a boy there, in for SI as well. I always point out that it isn't as creepy as it sounds- it's not like we tried to say we were dating while we were there. There was just mutual puppy love energy going on.\n\nDue to HIPPA, we weren't supposed to be telling each other our last names or where we lived. A lot of people weren't local, because anyone who has been inpatient psych knows that beds are a rarity, and you can be sent hours and hours away if you're unlucky. He wasn't local. When they were packing me up, a nurse had to go deal with something and told me to wait next to the nurse's station. I quickly snooped on some paperwork and found his last name. Sadly, it was a pretty common one, with a pretty common first name, as well. These were the days before everyone had every type of social media. I searched of Facebook, but couldn't pick out if any of them were him.\n\nThere was a mutual friend we had at the psych ward- a kid I had known my whole life, and one that the boy decided to reach out to. Two years later, he found me on the mutual friend's Facebook profile, and we reconnected. He lived about two hours away from me. I begged my mom to take me down there, and we met again. It was like a scene out of a Hallmark movie. I was an artistic kid, and I had drawn us meeting again after I left the psych ward. It was like my drawing had come to life. We ran to each other, met in the middle for a hug, hung off each other the whole day. I'll never forget that feeling. I left that day with a mutual agreement that we would try long-distance romance.\n\nSadly, it meant I couldn't be there to save him when shit started falling apart around him. His dad threatened him with a shotgun and went to jail. His mom couldn't have custody of him, and because he had had previous trouble with the law and mental health issues, they wouldnt grant him emancipation. He had to go into a group home. Group home did not let him have unfettered access to his phone, so we were limited on contact. I talked to him as much as I could. It was hard- I soothingly told him to trust the system, even though there were kids there that were bullying him. One night, he gets in a fight with two boys. It turned physical, and one boy got him in a chokehold while the other hit him. Staff was afraid to intervene, for fear they would get slapped with a lawsuit for improperly using restraints on the kids. My boyfriend was choked until he passed out and then went apneic. EMS revived him on the scene, but the damage was done.\n\nHe spent two days on life support. Because of him not having access to his phone, I only started to get suspicious on the second day of no contact. I logged onto Facebook and immediately started screaming. My timeline was filled with \"RIP Nick\". I had no idea, and that's how I found out. My fairytale became a horror story. It took me so long to recover from that. I was a sheltered kid, and I got this glimpse of a world where you might not actually live to see another day. No one murdered anyone in my rural town. It was just so far removed from my reality.\n\nIf you want to read the full story, search for Circle C Carrick Pittsburgh. It's heartbreaking. But I suppose I wouldn't avoid the heartbreak, if I had the chance. I was already a fucked up kid, and Nick made me realize I was worth loving. I hope I made him feel loved, too.\n",

Filled with hope, moving into adulthood, moving out of our parents houses, the whole \"Good Times On The Horizon(tm)\" vibe. \n\nThen, my aunt died a month before the wedding, and we had at around 8 other weddings (mostly of close friends) interspersed with 11 funerals of (mostly immediate) family over the next 3 years, culminating in the death of her father, and then six weeks later, my mother. Then the chaos stopped for a few years. \n\nWeird shit, man.\n",

				"Comment": "When I was 17, My car broke down and my parents had a car they weren't using so my Dad said, \"Just use ours and take over the car and insurance payments.\" I drove the car for a couple years, and every time there was a problem he said \"It's your car, you fix it\" which seemed completely reasonable, I put a lot of money into it.\n\nThen one day I got rear-ended completely not at fault and pretty minor damage. I was working with the claims department again, he once again said \"Your car your problem.\" Then one day, months after the accident he heard me talking to the claims department and didn't like how I was talking to them (I was talking to them with kindness and respect) and he went ballistic. \"It's my car! I don't want you talking to these people! You take this car to a shop and ask for a higher quote or you're not driving my car anymore!\" Screaming and threats. My Dad is notorious for being belligerent with people, so I knew that he was going to blow the claim. I ignored him and some how managed to get a few grand for the car (which is close to what the car was worth) and an outrageously high $3400 in pain and suffering. I used the money to move out of the house.\n",
